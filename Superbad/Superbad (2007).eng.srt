1
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,676
Yo.

2
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,902
Hey, I was doing some research
for next year...

3
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,014
...and I think I figured out
which website I wanna subscribe to.

4
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,242
- The Vag-tastic Voyage.
- Which one is the Vag-tastic Voyage?

5
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,215
<i>The Vag-tastic Voyage
is the one where...</i>

6
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,720
<i>...they find random girls on the street,
and they invite them into a van...</i>

7
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,688
...and then they bang them
in the van.

8
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,155
It's like 13 bucks a month...

9
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,022
...and you get access
to other sites.

10
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,530
Like one's Latina, one's Asian,
you know, there's one for fetishes...

11
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,225
...like feet and pee-pee and shit
and stuff like that.

12
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,200
That's disgusting.
You're like an animal.

13
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,874
I'm- What? I'm disgusting?
You're the weird one, man.

14
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,043
Don't make me feel weird
because I like porn.

15
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,542
You're weird for not liking porn.
I'm normal as shit.

16
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,509
Peeing on people. That's normal?

17
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,047
Evan, I'm not saying
I'm gonna look at it.

18
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,617
I'm just saying that
it comes with the site, okay?

19
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,186
I don't know what I'm gonna be into
10 years from now.

20
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,084
I'm just sick of all the amateur stuff.

21
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,454
I mean, like, if I'm paying top dollar,
I want a little production value.

22
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,391
Like some editing, transition,
something. Some music.

23
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:48,432
Yeah, well, I'm sorry the Coen brothers
don't direct the porn that I watch.

24
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,193
They're hard to get ahold of, okay?

25
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,236
Plus your parents are gonna be
looking at the bill, dipshit.

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,843
Yeah, you're right. I probably should
pick the one with the least dirty name.

27
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,139
What about, like, Perfect Ten?

28
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,146
Something like that, you know?

29
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,909
Like Perfect Ten?

30
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,950
Because that could be
any number of things.

31
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:11,521
They can't really get you for that.
That could be, like, a bowling website.

32
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,751
Yeah, but they don't really show dick
going in, which is a huge concern.

33
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:16,929
I didn't realize that.

34
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,690
Plus, have you ever seen
a vagina by itself?

35
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,296
Not for me.

36
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,935
Hi.

37
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,932
- Thanks for taking him, Seth.
- No- No problem, Jane.

38
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,371
- How are you?
- Good.

39
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,169
Beautiful.

40
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,773
- Don't touch that.
- What are you-?

41
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,074
- I'm not a piece of meat.
- You two are funny.

42
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,047
I can't imagine what you're gonna do
without each other next year.

43
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,279
Evan told me
you didn't get into Dartmouth.

44
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:48,151
I got into some schools, some
pretty good ones. So I'll be fine.

45
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,353
- You gonna miss each other?
- No. Miss each other? No, thank you.

46
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,122
I don't- I don't miss each other.

47
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,130
I'm gonna cry myself
to sleep every night.

48
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,893
- Me too.
- When I'm out partying.

49
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,695
Go to school, boys.

50
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,866
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Jane.

51
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,908
I am truly jealous you got to suck
on those tits when you were a baby.

52
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,015
Yeah, well, at least you got to
suck on your dad's dick.

53
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,355
Hey, Seth,
you can't park in the faculty lot.

54
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,466
Don't be such a vagine, man.
I gotta get a Red Bull before class.

55
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,627
You're being an idiot.
You shouldn't have parked there.

56
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,363
Fuck it. I'm about to graduate.

57
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,338
They should be sucking
on my ball sac.

58
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,272
It's the least they could do
for stealing three years of my life.

59
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,945
- Oh, fuck me.
- Look at those nipples.

60
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,088
They're like little baby toes.

61
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,349
It's not fair
they get to flaunt that stuff...

62
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,652
...and I have to hide
every erection I get.

63
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,489
You know what I do?
I flip my boner up into my waistband.

64
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,688
It hides it and it feels awesome.

65
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,333
I almost blew a load
into my bellybutton.

66
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,504
I mean, just imagine if girls weren't
weirded out by our boners...

67
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,366
...and just, like,
wanted to see them.

68
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,668
I mean, that's the world
I one day wanna live in.

69
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:14,005
It's been two years since I've seen
an actual human female nipple.

70
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,182
Shauna?
Shauna was two years ago now?

71
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,350
Yeah.

72
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,984
Yeah, I guess so.
But she was insanely hot.

73
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,383
Exactly. She was too hot, okay?
That's what sucks.

74
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,854
How can that suck?
I'd be psyched if I got with her.

75
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,549
You got, like, two dozen handjobs.

76
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,457
Yes, and three-quarters of a blowjob,
but who's counting?

77
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,756
Look, it was the peak
of my ass-getting career...

78
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,524
...and it happened way too early.

79
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,668
- You're like Orson Welles.
- Exactly!

80
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,361
If I'd paced myself,
I'd be having at least steady sex...

81
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,869
...With a decent-looking girl.

82
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,043
I honestly see now why Orson Welles
ate his fat ass to death.

83
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,041
You'll have sex in college,
everyone does.

84
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:49,340
But the point is to be good at sex
by the time you get to college.

85
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,382
You don't want girls thinking
you suck dick at fucking pussy.

86
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,553
I still think you have
a chance with Jules.

87
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,551
She got incredibly hot over
last summer...

88
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,724
...and she obviously
hasn't realized it yet...

89
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,587
...because she's still talking to you
and flirting with you.

90
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,821
Are you out of your mind?
Look at Jules' dating record, okay?

91
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,364
She dated Dan Remick, who's had
a six-pack since, like, kindergarten.

92
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,129
Jason Stone, who looks like
fucking Zack Morris. And Matt Muir.

93
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,602
Matt Muir.
He's the sweetest guy ever.

94
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,639
Have you ever stared into his eyes?

95
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,403
It was like the first time
I heard the Beatles.

96
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,673
Why would she end
her high school career with me?

97
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,907
Becca dated Eric Rosecrantz
for like two years.

98
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,417
Yeah, but he's a fucking idiot.
You're a step up from that dick-load.

99
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,714
That's why you need to stop-
Will you get this?

100
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,324
That's why you need to stop
being a pussy and nail her.

101
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,289
You could bang her
before you leave.

102
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,430
And I'm not gonna dance around it,
she looks like a good fucker.

103
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,031
I'm tired of you talking
about her like that, man.

104
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,692
What, you can talk about her all day
and if I say one thing, it's blasphemy?

105
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,462
Well, I don't constantly insult her.

106
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,072
I'm not trying to insult her.

107
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,799
I'm just saying that
she looks like a good fucker, okay?

108
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,534
She looks like she can take a dick.

109
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,305
Some women pride themselves
on their dick-taking abilities.

110
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,416
Dick-taking abilities? You think
that's good to say about someone?

111
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,813
The fucked-up thing is,
I actually do, okay?

112
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,615
If a woman tried to compliment me on
my dick-giving abilities, I'd be psyched.

113
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,189
Hey, yo, Seth.

114
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,428
What?

115
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,655
Did you hear I'm having
a big grad party next Saturday?

116
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,034
- No.
- Yeah.

117
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,603
- Oh, shit!
- You're not coming.

118
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,504
Tell your fucking faggot friend
he can't come either.

119
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,843
So Jesse wanted me to tell you...

120
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,415
...you're a fucking faggot
and can't come to his party.

121
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,484
You really bitched out
back there, man.

122
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,018
I bitched out?

123
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,986
You bitched out, man,
you fucking Judas.

124
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,386
You fucking left me hanging.

125
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,584
Did you want me to dive
in front of his spit?

126
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,725
Come on, guys, let's go!

127
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,239
This is bullshit.

128
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,577
Pussy.

129
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,749
If I equals the square root
of negative one...

130
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:16,520
...then I squared equals
negative one. Okay?

131
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,959
In other words,
if you consider I as a constant...

132
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,931
...you can then define the square roots
of all the negative numbers.

133
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:27,806
So I is an imaginary number.
It doesn't really exist.

134
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,067
If I equals the square root
of negative one...

135
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,268
...then I squared equals
negative one.

136
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,141
Is this making s-? Okay.

137
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,052
- Okay, bye.
- Evan!

138
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,058
- Evan, hey.
- Hey, Becca.

139
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,851
- Hey, thank you for your pen.
- Hey.

140
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,689
No problem. No, no, don't worry.
No worries. You keep it.

141
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,458
You won't have to borrow one again
because you'll have that one.

142
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,535
- Thank you so much, that's...
- You're welcome. Don't worry about it.

143
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,365
So I was gonna ask you...

144
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,064
...did you hear about
Jesse's grad party next weekend?

145
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,837
- It should be fun.
- I heard. L- It's a maybe.

146
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,536
- Really?
- For me at the moment.

147
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,276
- My R.S.V.P.
- Just a maybe?

148
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,450
So far.

149
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,313
There's so much other fun shit
that's gonna be happening...

150
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,546
...that I can't really commit and,
you know, hurt someone's feelings.

151
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,817
Fun shit? But I never see you
at parties or anything.

152
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,492
That's because of
all the other fun shit I'm off doing.

153
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,426
I'd love to be at all of them, but...

154
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,464
Why weren't you
at Dimitri's on Saturday?

155
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,158
There was so many things
going on.

156
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,463
I couldn't find a minute
to make an appearance.

157
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,108
- What did you do?
- Saturday was a crazy night for me.

158
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,112
<i>I had some friends over,
we had a few drinks.</i>

159
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,145
<i>That's Vag-tastic!</i>

160
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,079
<i>I hung out in my basement,
the chill zone, where we chill-lax.</i>

161
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,914
<i>Like "relax" and "chill"
all at once.</i>

162
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,513
Seth's parents
Were throwing a party.

163
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,659
<i>We got to hang around adults,
which was a nice change of pace.</i>

164
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:58,297
<i>You converse, you talk to people
and they have interesting stories.</i>

165
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:02,161
<i>I talked to a man who claimed he had
climbed five mountains in his life.</i>

166
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,800
Then we went to a nightclub, which
was incredible. This big, fancy one.

167
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,769
<i>- Gonna look at tits right now!
- I'm feeling crazy. I said that.</i>

168
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,440
<i>- You got in?
- We got right in.</i>

169
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,441
- Wanna do this, 'roid monkey?
- Fuck you!

170
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:17,013
<i>Then we called it a night.
We were all just really exhausted.</i>

171
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,979
What the fuck?!

172
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,416
You would've loved it. It was
an incredible, unbelievable night.

173
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,919
That sounds like a lot of fun.

174
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,024
You know, I'd love to go
do something like that sometime.

175
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,853
Who wouldn't? I mean, it was like...

176
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,259
...me and Seth are
always kind of cooking up these...

177
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,093
...fun, sort of,
little, you know, events.

178
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,031
I guess you guys are really
gonna go crazy next year together.

179
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,967
We were going to,
but we got into different schools.

180
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,199
Really? That sucks.

181
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,635
Yeah, I mean, it's not too bad.
I mean, it should be okay.

182
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,404
Not too worried about it, really.

183
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,208
Don't worry about it.
I'm not worried at all.

184
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:56,321
- All right, well, thank you for the pen.
- Yeah. No problem.

185
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,389
- Bye.
- Bye.

186
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,856
Bye, Evan.

187
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:14,236
Mrs. Hayworth, I joined this class
because I'd be cooking with a partner.

188
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,001
But she's never here, and I don't get
twice the grades for doing all the work.

189
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,270
I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.

190
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,506
I know, but look at Evan, okay?
Just look at him.

191
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,174
Don't keep me waiting much longer.
I'm getting impatient up here.

192
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:30,185
You know what I'm talking about.
Miroki, you're embarrassing me.

193
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,791
I'm here in my unit, isolated and alone,
eating my terrible-tasting food...

194
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,460
...and I gotta look over at that.

195
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,856
Looks like the most fun
I've ever seen in my life.

196
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,192
And it's B.S. Excuse my language.
I'm just saying that I wash and dry.

197
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,527
I'm like a single mother.

198
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,703
We all know Home Ec is a joke,
no offense.

199
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,305
Everyone takes this class to get an A.
It's bullshit, and I'm sorry.

200
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,443
I'm not putting down your profession,
but it's just the way I feel.

201
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,942
I don't wanna sit here alone
cooking this shitty food.

202
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:58,106
No offense. And I just think
that I don't ever need to cook tiramisu.

203
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,046
When am I gonna need
to cook tiramisu?

204
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,618
Am I gonna be a chef? No.

205
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,813
There's three weeks left in school.
Give me a fucking break.

206
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,185
I'm sorry for cursing.

207
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,692
All right, Jules' partner isn't here
today either.

208
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,330
Pair up with her. Station four.

209
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,657
Jules?

210
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,732
All right. I'll give it another shot.

211
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,928
I'll give Home Ec another shot.

212
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,744
Hey, Jules.
Your partner didn't come today?

213
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,483
- That's kind of a personal question.
- What?

214
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,147
Nothing. It's my attempt at humor.
I was just-

215
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,153
Oh, like coming.

216
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,418
Like "coming" coming.

217
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,965
Wow, that was a little too far
right there. The gesture.

218
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,067
Yeah. It's pretty far.
Shit, I do that-

219
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,635
No, don't worry.
I'm actually used to it.

220
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,433
My older brother says, like,
the nastiest shit.

221
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,768
Like he called me "hymen"
until I was 12.

222
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,512
- That's sick. That's not even clever.
- I know.

223
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,680
I know.

224
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,441
I would've gone with something
at least mildly entertaining.

225
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,050
You know, like- Like-
Like "family Jules. "

226
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,656
Or like "nuts. " Yeah, that's funny.
That's a fucking funny joke.

227
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,059
Fucking funny.

228
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,629
- I can't believe that.
- So, all right. We gotta...

229
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,797
...mix it up.

230
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:59,036
Yeah, Hayworth will notice this,
if we cover it with chocolate.

231
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,531
- The whole thing?
- Just dump it on. I'm serious.

232
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:02,765
Okay.

233
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,443
- And now it looks professional.
- That's really impressive.

234
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:09,080
- It's beautifully done.
- I think we're gonna get an A.

235
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,676
So, what are you doing tonight?

236
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,749
- Probably nothing. Why?
- I don't know.

237
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,946
My parents are gone
so I'm having a party.

238
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,751
I don't really know how many people
are gonna be there...

239
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,224
...but you could stop by
if you wanted to.

240
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,923
Yeah, I love parties.

241
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,957
Really?

242
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,666
I just don't really ever
see you at them.

243
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,565
You know, it's a love-hate thing.

244
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:36,105
So, like, you know, right now,
I really love them, though.

245
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,776
- Yeah.
- Good shit, right, Miroki?

246
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,271
Yeah.

247
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,108
Hey, Miroki, could we have
a minute alone? Just- Thanks.

248
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,877
Dude, Jules is having
a fucking party.

249
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,451
Hey!

250
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:52,119
- Don't tell Fogell about the party.
- Gangsters. What's up, guys?

251
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,651
I was just walking down the hall
and Nicola was right in front of me.

252
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,796
She's wearing these tight white pants
with this black G-string...

253
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:02,024
...and you could see right
through the pants. It was so sweet.

254
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,544
It's 10:33.

255
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,416
What?

256
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,748
I told her what time it was.

257
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,889
That's the coolest fucking story
I've ever heard in my entire life.

258
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,651
- Can I hear it again? You have time?
- Yeah, yeah, Seth.

259
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,658
I'll miss your knee-slappers
when me and Evan are at Dartmouth.

260
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,956
While you guys are at Dartmouth,
I'll be at State...

261
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,259
...Where the girls are half as smart
and twice as likely to fellash me.

262
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,869
What are you guys doing tonight?
Asshole.

263
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,266
We got nothing.
Nothing tonight, Fogell.

264
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,341
No? Well, if nothing comes up,
We can get shitfaced again, yeah?

265
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,273
You're always calling me a pussy,
but today you're wrong.

266
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,914
At lunch, I'm going to the same place
Mike Snider went...

267
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,482
...to pick up my brand-new fake ID.

268
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,788
Yeah. Fake ID. Fake ID. I'm tight.

269
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,423
That's insane. Evan was like,
"I heard about this party.

270
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,560
We shouldn't tell Fogell. "
I was like, "No, we should tell Fogell. "

271
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,889
You could buy us booze now.
It's awesome.

272
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:08,555
Yeah, I'll- Sure, I'll buy the booze.
Yeah, we're gonna get our drinks on.

273
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,259
We're gonna party
and get crunk and rock out, dude.

274
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,529
If you're not in this class,
leave this class.

275
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,900
Fogell! Hi.

276
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,166
Okay. Gotta go.

277
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,367
Well done. Seriously.
See you after class.

278
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,708
You tell that idiot
you're not rooming with him?

279
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:22,881
Not yet. No.

280
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,812
All right, well, you better.
That guy's the fucking anti-poon.

281
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,952
Seth, it's dishes time.
What's the holdup?

282
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,412
We're getting a fake ID, so...

283
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,387
- It's not like a big deal.
- Wow, that's cool.

284
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,719
But you guys have, like,
four more years to go...

285
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,327
...so do you wanna get to work?

286
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,896
Well, we got into
different schools, so...

287
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,192
So you're cutting the cord?
What's gonna happen?

288
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,961
Nothing. Jeez, what does
everybody think is gonna happen?

289
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,004
The world's gonna explode if we
don't spend every second together?

290
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,573
I mean, we're not dependent
on each other, you know.

291
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,176
We met when we were 8.
We were fine before then.

292
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,177
I was. I mean, it's like,
We don't do everything together.

293
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,077
No. All right, I gotta take a piss.

294
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,912
My dick's not gonna shake itself.
Come on, babe.

295
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,885
- He's a crack-up.
- I'm just gonna go.

296
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,060
Well, at least
We're getting a graduation party.

297
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,389
Thank God, man.

298
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,463
I'm excited.

299
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:18,125
I would do terrible, disgusting things
to hook up with Jules.

300
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,100
- Unforgivable things.
- I hear you, man.

301
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,433
I'd give my middle nut
to start dating Becca.

302
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,541
Becca's a bitch.

303
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,372
You know what? I'm seriously
getting fucking sick of you...

304
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,014
...talking about her like that,
if we can be honest.

305
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,843
- Me too.
- Why do you hate her so much?

306
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,451
You've never given me a reason.
I think you like her.

307
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,948
- Fuck no, man! I hate Becca.
- Why, man?

308
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,625
Fine, Evan. Here it comes.

309
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,624
When I was a little kid,
I kind of had this problem.

310
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,456
And it's not even that big of a deal.

311
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,394
Something like 8 percent of kids
do it, but whatever. It's...

312
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:55,029
For some reason, I don't know why,
I would just kind of sit around all day...

313
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,573
...and draw pictures of dicks.

314
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:01,704
What?

315
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,341
Draw pictures of dicks.

316
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,082
Dicks?

317
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,082
Like a man dick?

318
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,589
Yeah. Like a man dick.

319
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,657
<i>I'd sit there for hours, drawing dicks.
I don't know what it was.</i>

320
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:20,628
<i>I couldn't touch the pen to paper
without drawing the shape of a penis.</i>

321
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,097
<i>- That's fucked.
- No shit, it's really fucked up.</i>

322
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,564
<i>Here I am, this little kid...</i>

323
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,705
<i>...and I can't stop drawing dicks
to save my own life.</i>

324
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,512
All right. I mean, I don't see
What this has to do with Becca.

325
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,084
Just listen. Okay?

326
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,451
<i>Your precious little Becca
sat next to me for all of fourth grade.</i>

327
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,787
<i>And in the classroom is where
I did the majority of my illustrations.</i>

328
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,826
<i>I was very secretive about this
whole dick operation I had going on.</i>

329
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,591
<i>Even I thought I was fucking crazy.</i>

330
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,462
<i>Imagine what everyone else
would think.</i>

331
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,638
<i>So I would stash
all of my dick drawings...</i>

332
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,706
<i>...in this Ghostbusters lunchbox
that I had.</i>

333
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:07,106
<i>So one day I'm finishing up this
real big, veiny, triumphant bastard.</i>

334
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,405
<i>All of a sudden...</i>

335
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,343
Pussy!

336
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,719
You hit Becca's foot with your dick?

337
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,650
Yeah. I know.

338
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,139
Oh, my God!

339
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:38,603
<i>She starts crying. She flips out.
And she rats me out to the principal.</i>

340
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,302
<i>He finds this Ghostbusters lunchbox
dick treasure chest...</i>

341
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,912
<i>...and he fucking flips out.</i>

342
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,760
<i>He calls in my parents. Turns out this
principal is some religious fanatic...</i>

343
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,122
<i>...and he thinks I'm possessed
by some dick devil.</i>

344
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,766
<i>My parents make me see a therapist,
and he's asking me dick questions.</i>

345
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,197
<i>They made me stop eating foods
shaped like dicks.</i>

346
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,030
<i>No hot dogs, no Popsicles.</i>

347
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,105
You know how many foods are
shaped like dicks? The best kinds.

348
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,741
Yeah.

349
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,478
Well, I don't-
That's really messed up.

350
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,508
- Super gay.
- All right, let's stop this madness.

351
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,947
- Let's just go get some dessert.
- I can't, I gotta go meet my counselor.

352
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,451
I'm picking out my classes
for next year.

353
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:28,517
So I gotta sit and eat dessert alone,
like I'm fucking Steven Glanzberg?

354
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,661
I gue- Yeah, I mean,
What do you want me to do?

355
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,790
I don't know. Nothing. It's fine.

356
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,233
- Just relax, man. I'll see you later.
- That's fine. I'll be fine.

357
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,513
Hey, pussy.

358
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,579
Fuck off.

359
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,478
Just the one. Just the one. Not both.

360
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,312
- So I'll call Andy and Greg.
- Okay.

361
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,988
And I'll bring the '80s dance music.

362
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,781
- Yeah, yeah.
- Right on.

363
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,425
Seth! Hi. There you are.
We were just talking about you.

364
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,822
- Here I am.
- That's weird.

365
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,759
So you're coming to my party tonight?
Because it's fully on.

366
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:10,026
Yeah, why? Should I not come?
Because I could think of other shit...

367
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,726
Oh, no. No.
I want you to come, I just-

368
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,169
You said something earlier about,
like, a fake ID or something, right?

369
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,935
Yeah, I'm gonna get one.
For sure, for sure.

370
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,874
I'm getting that for sure.

371
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,613
Can you get us booze?

372
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,384
Yeah. I can.
I can get you guys alcohol.

373
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,112
- Really? Seriously?
- Yes, for sure.

374
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,881
That would be awesome.
Thank you.

375
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,560
Because we were worried about that.
That would be great.

376
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,423
Plus, you know, you scratch
our backs, we'll scratch yours.

377
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,655
Well, Jules, the funny thing
about my back...

378
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,357
...is that it's located on my cock.

379
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,872
So you do want alcohol?
You want some or no?

380
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,268
You do or you don't?
You do want alcohol.

381
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,807
- Yeah.
- Either way.

382
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,002
- Well-
- Either way. Either way's fine.

383
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,942
This is actually kind of a big favor.

384
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:00,084
Because my parents left me like
100 bucks to feed myself for the week.

385
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,482
But the house is full of food,
so I just thought I'd spend it all...

386
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,487
...on, you know,
extra drinks for the party, so...

387
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,820
That's really nice. I don't think
I've ever done anything that nice.

388
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,553
- It's cool?
- Yeah.

389
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:12,924
- Okay. Thank you.
- Awesome.

390
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:16,101
I mean, seriously, that's really-
That's nice of you. Thank you.

391
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,930
So should I just get a shitload
of different shit?

392
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,071
Well, you gotta get me
some Kyle's Killer Lemonade.

393
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:26,506
Kyle's Killer Lemonade. That's kind of
gay, but I can get it for you.

394
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,947
So- Okay, so then
We will see you tonight.

395
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,979
Go to the ball, guys.

396
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,911
Evan. Get into the game.

397
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,386
Kick it over to me.

398
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,647
Seth! Get off the field!

399
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,018
Get out of here.
They're gonna make me run laps.

400
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,420
Just fucking listen, okay?

401
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:46,086
Jules and her stupid fucking friend
asked me to buy her alcohol.

402
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,233
But not just her, for her whole party.
You know what that means?

403
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,598
By some miracle, we were paired up
and she actually thought of me.

404
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:55,501
Thought of me enough to decide
I was the guy she would trust...

405
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,505
...with the whole fun-ness of her party.
She wants to fuck me.

406
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,543
She wants my dick
in or around her mouth.

407
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,511
Did you think that maybe
she's using you to get her alcohol?

408
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,241
- She doesn't want your dick.
- Of course I thought of that.

409
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,444
The first thing that came
to my mind. Listen.

410
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,748
My older brother always says
the nastiest shit.

411
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,425
Like he called me "hymen"
until I was 12.

412
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,116
Seth, I wanna blow you.

413
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,257
She didn't say that. Come on.

414
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,295
She didn't say the second part,
the first-

415
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,899
She's got an older brother.
She could have asked him.

416
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,694
She looked me in the eyes and said:

417
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,634
"Seth, Mom is making a pubie salad.
I need some Seth's Own dressing. "

418
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,207
She's D.T.F.
She's down to fuck, man.

419
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,072
P in vagi.
She wants to fuck, man.

420
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,941
Tonight is the night
that fucking is an actual possibility.

421
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,777
You sound like an idiot.
You're not gonna sleep with her.

422
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,250
No. Dude, I know
I talk a lot of shit, okay?

423
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,049
But she's gonna be at the party
and she's gonna be drunk.

424
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,659
She likes me at least a little.
At the very least, I'll make out with her.

425
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,853
Two weeks, handjob.
Month, blowjob. Whatever.

426
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,622
And then I make her my girlfriend.

427
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,800
And I've got, like,
two solid months of sex.

428
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,593
By the time college rolls around...

429
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,067
...I'll be like the Iron Chef
of pounding vag.

430
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,569
Can we talk about this later?

431
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,707
What the fuck, Evan?
We're down two points.

432
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,740
Fucking calm down, Greg.
It's soccer.

433
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,536
- It's soccer.
- Fuck you, man.

434
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,976
Hey, Greg, why don't you go
piss your pants again?

435
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,707
- That was eight years ago, asshole.
- People don't forget.

436
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,977
Do you wanna hear the best part?
Becca.

437
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,984
You do the same thing with her.

438
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,282
When you guys are shitfaced,
you get with her.

439
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,255
This is our last party
as high school people.

440
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,328
I've ignored my hatred for Becca
in coming up with this plan.

441
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:28,295
I'm flexing nuts. Just fucking
come with me on this voyage...

442
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,058
...and stop being a pussy
for once...

443
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,295
...and we can fucking
fuck some girls already.

444
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,204
- I should buy Becca alcohol?
- Yeah, it'll be pimp.

445
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,275
That way you know she'll be drunk.
You know when girls say:

446
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,641
"I was so shitfaced last night.
I shouldn't have fucked that guy. "

447
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,213
We could be that mistake!

448
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,780
Have you talked to Fogell?

449
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,887
All right, you talk to Becca.
I'll talk to that retard, Fogell.

450
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,056
Don't worry.

451
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:55,192
- Seth, get off the field!
- Goal.

452
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,123
- You're getting that!
- No, I'm not!

453
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,964
Hey, Becca. Hey, hold up.

454
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,135
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

455
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,736
Hi. Did you hear
about the party tonight?

456
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,907
Yeah. Yeah, I just heard.
It sounds awesome.

457
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,075
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going.

458
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,607
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm gonna go.

459
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,369
That's why I came looking for you.

460
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,741
Me and the guys are gonna
go to a liquor store.

461
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,473
And I just thought, you know...

462
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,346
...if you needed someone
to get you yours, I could do that.

463
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,077
I could be that person.

464
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,516
Yeah.

465
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,213
Yeah, no, that would be great.

466
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:29,758
That would save me such a hassle,
because I was gonna beg my sister.

467
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,328
Could you get me, like,
a bottle of Goldslick Vodka?

468
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,125
Yeah. That's the one
With the little golden flakes in it?

469
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,996
- Yeah. The girly one.
- That's classy.

470
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,932
Well, I'll pay you back at the party.

471
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,867
No, you won't.
No, it's my treat, miss.

472
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,336
- Really?
- Yep. That's that.

473
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,409
It's the first of many too,
so get used to it, sister.

474
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,807
Well, thank you.

475
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,845
Yeah, no problem.

476
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,053
- I'm sorry. It was an accident.
- It's okay.

477
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,853
I was gonna give you a nudge-
A punch, the friend thing.

478
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,085
I didn't mean-

479
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,729
- Hey, Becca.
- Hey.

480
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:06,955
- Hey.
- Gaby.

481
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,359
- What's up, Evan?
- Hey, Gaby.

482
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,398
- We should get to class.
- We're gonna go.

483
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,160
- So I will see you tonight.
- Okay.

484
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:13,929
- Really, don't worry.
- Okay. Sorry.

485
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,198
- Bye.
- Sorry.

486
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,739
Bye.

487
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,871
Sorry.

488
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,120
Where's that sack of shit, Fogell?
He said he'd be here.

489
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,756
I'm here with my thumb up my ass.

490
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,949
I did it, dude.
I even offered to pay for it.

491
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,025
It was pimp.
I feel like a pimp right now.

492
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,857
- Like one of those pimps.
- That is fucking pimp.

493
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,228
- That's what I was afraid of.
- Why didn't I think of that? Shit.

494
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:46,801
Sh- we're screwed.

495
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,267
- Okay? We're screwed.
- Okay.

496
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,498
This is what we get
for trusting Fogell, okay?

497
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,870
He pussied out.
I know he pussied out.

498
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,280
What are you making?

499
00:26:55,814 --> 00:27:00,217
I'm just drilling holes.
The last two weeks. Fuck it.

500
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:03,177
What do we tell the girls,
We couldn't do the one thing...

501
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,549
...we promised because
we're dickless incompetents?

502
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,851
Now we're never gonna bone
because of that used tampon, Fogell.

503
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,758
How'd he get into Dartmouth?
I don't get it. He's got shit for brains.

504
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,864
All right,
how else can we get alcohol?

505
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,797
- Yo, guys! What's up?
- Fogell, where have you been, man?

506
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,868
You almost gave me
a goddamn heart attack.

507
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:23,269
- Let me see it. Did you pussy out?
- No, no, man. I got it.

508
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,534
It's flawless. Check it.

509
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:26,938
Hawaii?

510
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,773
All right, that's good.
It's hard to trace, I guess.

511
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,348
Wait, you changed your name
to McLovin?

512
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,183
- Yeah.
- McLovin?

513
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:40,349
What kind of a stupid name is that?
Are you an Irish R & B singer?

514
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,891
They let you pick any name you want
when you're there.

515
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,687
And you landed on McLovin?

516
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,057
Yeah, it was between that
or Mohammad.

517
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,426
Why the fuck would it be
between that or Mohammad?

518
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,625
Why not just pick
a common name?

519
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,965
Mohammad is the most common name
on earth. Read a fucking book.

520
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,970
Have you ever met anyone
named Mohammad?

521
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,972
Have you ever met anyone
named McLovin?

522
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,270
No, that's why you picked
a dumb fucking name.

523
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,742
- Fuck you.
- Give me that.

524
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:06,349
All right. You look like a future
pedophile in this picture, number one.

525
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,645
Number two, it doesn't even have
a first name. It just says McLovin!

526
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:10,947
What? One name?

527
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,716
One name? Who are you, Seal?

528
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,223
Fogell, this ID says
you're 25 years old.

529
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,986
Why wouldn't you just put 21, man?

530
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,221
Seth, Seth, Seth.
Listen up, ass-face.

531
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,924
Every day, hundreds of kids go into
the liquor store with their fake IDs...

532
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,933
...and every single one
says they're 21.

533
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,867
How many 21-year-olds
are in this town?

534
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,472
It's called fucking strategy.

535
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,835
Let's stay calm, okay?
Let's not lose our heads.

536
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,171
It's a fine ID. It'll- It's gonna work.
It's passable, okay?

537
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,905
This isn't terrible.
I mean, it's up to you, Fogell.

538
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,641
This guy's gonna think,
"Here's a kid with a fake ID"...

539
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:45,084
...or "Here's McLovin, the 25-year-old
Hawaiian organ donor. "

540
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,451
Okay? So, what's it gonna be?

541
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:49,483
I am McLovin.

542
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,157
No, you're not. No one's McLovin.
McLovin's never existed...

543
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:56,732
...because that's a made-up, dumb,
fucking fairy-tale name, you fuck!

544
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,267
Jeez, man. It'll work.
Give it a chance.

545
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,836
Did you move my-?

546
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,301
Where is my car?

547
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,906
Oh, my God, man.

548
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,475
What did I say to you?
I told you not to park here.

549
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,078
Why would you park
in the staff parking lot?

550
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,578
Shut the fuck up, Fogell.

551
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,342
I mean, because you're not staff.

552
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:17,079
I know that, Fagell! I know that!

553
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,356
Evan, let's go to your house.

554
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,122
Wait, are you guys
still picking me up from work?

555
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,123
Can you answer me?

556
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,667
Man, don't you have
any non-infant clothes?

557
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,707
- It'll be fine.
- Yeah.

558
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,069
Why don't you just wear
what you wore to school?

559
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,337
I can't do that. I can't let Jules
see me in what I wore to school.

560
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:43,980
It's completely unbecoming.

561
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:47,583
No one's gotten a handjob
in cargo shorts since Nam.

562
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,653
I have to kill these guys.
You don't negotiate with terrorists.

563
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:53,689
Really? Yeah, that's what
we should be talking about right now.

564
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,360
Then why don't you go
and get some of your own clothes?

565
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,926
That's the dumbest thing ever.

566
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,257
My parents will see that my car's
been towed and I'll be grounded.

567
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,593
These fucking terrorists
multiply like bunnies.

568
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,099
Where did I leave the M16?

569
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,704
Do you have any bigger clothes
or do you only shop at babyGap?

570
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,137
Fuck me. I can't-

571
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,940
That's fun.
Why do they make that?

572
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,205
If you can't even win,
then why am I fucking playing?

573
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,178
Do you wanna go see
what my dad has?

574
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,771
<i>What the fuck?</i>

575
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,405
What the hell is that?

576
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,548
It's a fucking vest, dumbass.

577
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,218
- I'm trying to look older.
- You look like Pinocchio.

578
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,910
- It's just a vest.
- They got a lot of booze in there.

579
00:30:57,122 --> 00:31:00,091
If we get it now, we can get
to the party faster with Jules' shit.

580
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,487
No way, man. I work there.
They know I'm not 25.

581
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,719
Nobody said anything about you,
dick-mouth.

582
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,955
You really fucked me on this one.

583
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,962
So now I'm gonna steal the booze.

584
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,931
Don't do this.
I promise you I'll get the liquor later.

585
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,435
Mike Snider's ID always works.
So will mine, man.

586
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,075
Mike Snider's ID doesn't have
one fucking name on it! Okay?

587
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,871
I thought you Dartmouth guys would
be smart enough to understand that.

588
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,746
Now Seth's gotta
pick up all the pieces.

589
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,611
He won't do it. Don't worry.

590
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:30,015
I forgot to tell you, my mom said we
can have the TV from the basement-

591
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,916
Shut the fuck up,
he's gonna hear you.

592
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,920
Just be quiet.
Wait until he goes away.

593
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,685
You still haven't told him
that we're rooming together?

594
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,328
Fogell, shut the fuck up.

595
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,623
And take off your vest.
You look like Aladdin.

596
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,528
Okay. You got it.

597
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,302
Hope piggy can run.

598
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,052
How old are you?

599
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,821
Twenty-two.

600
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,960
You certainly are.
That'll be 80 dollars.

601
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,264
Okay.

602
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,769
Thank you kindly. Will that do?

603
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,168
Certainly will. Thank you, Seth.

604
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,344
Hey, thank you.

605
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,388
You dropped your purse, ma'am.

606
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,023
Would you like some help?

607
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,420
Well, that would be lovely,
young man.

608
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,721
Would you like me
to buy you alcohol?

609
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:48,222
That would be lovely.

610
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,993
- Enjoy your remaining years.
- I will.

611
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:54,501
- Enjoy fucking Jules.
- I will.

612
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,452
Don't do it, kid.

613
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,598
I never had a choice.

614
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,571
You fucking killed her!

615
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:32,610
No!

616
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,923
Where's all the stolen liquor?
Did you hide it up your butt?

617
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,922
Piss off! I was gonna do it,
but there was a security breach.

618
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,355
You never would've done it.

619
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,793
Let's go to a liquor store
and watch your stupid ID get rejected.

620
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,432
Wait, I'm gonna go put my vest
back in my locker.

621
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,155
All right. Here we are. This is it.

622
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,660
- You ready? Yeah?
- Yeah.

623
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,266
- Here's the money and the list.
- Change is yours. Keep the change.

624
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,529
- Thank you. What's the list for?
- The alcohol.

625
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,640
We're gonna get alcohol
for the whole party, okay?

626
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:40,504
We put a lot of time into this list,
so don't fuck it up.

627
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:41,679
It's perfect.

628
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,213
Ouzo, bourbon,
spiced rum, Goldslick...

629
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,884
Goldslick Vodka. That's for Becca.
Don't forget that.

630
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,819
Raspberry vodka, Scotch...

631
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,785
And Kyle's Killer Lemonade.
A six-pack.

632
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,892
This is a lot. I don't know
if I can get away with all this.

633
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,493
What difference does it make?

634
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:01,062
I don't know, man.
I'm, like, really nervous.

635
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,134
- Are you okay?
- No, man. I should have wore the vest.

636
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,667
- Calm down.
- What the fuck are you doing?

637
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,736
What if I go in
and they turn me down, man?

638
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,805
Then we're in the same place
we're in now.

639
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,704
- Who cares?
- It's fucking humiliating!

640
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,708
Everybody sees them
kicking me out.

641
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:18,007
What if they make me
put the liquor back? I can't do that.

642
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,582
This whole thing
is bigger than you, Fogell!

643
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,152
So grow a pair of nuts and fucking
walk in there and buy the alcohol!

644
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,884
What if I don't feel like it
anymore, Seth? What?

645
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,888
Then I'll fucking kill you, okay?

646
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,061
I'll stab you
through your fucking heart.

647
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,752
No, you can do this, man.
Come on.

648
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,831
Killing me won't get you alcohol.
I'm the one with the fake ID.

649
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,025
Then I'll cut
your dumb fucking face off...

650
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,330
...throw it over mine and get your ID
and buy it my fucking self!

651
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,406
Oh, really? You don't have
the technology or the steady hands...

652
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,577
...to pull off a procedure like that,
so ha!

653
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:48,268
Peace.

654
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,438
Fogell, just be cool, man.
Get in and get out.

655
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,616
You're the hero.

656
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,887
Sorry.

657
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,645
Is there a problem here, sir?

658
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,186
No. No problem whatsoever.

659
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:38,055
Sir, did you do this? On the floor?

660
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:39,730
No.

661
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,558
And you should really clean this up.

662
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,927
Someone could really
hurt themselves.

663
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,568
Fuck my life.

664
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,605
We're so fucked.
We're so fucked.

665
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,638
This plan's been fucked
since Jump Street.

666
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,437
Okay, just calm down.
Just calm down, all right?

667
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,709
Hey, so did you bring a condom
for tonight?

668
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,850
You brought a condom with you?

669
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,916
Yeah. I figured
I might as well, you know?

670
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,645
I brought a little bottle
of spermicidal lube too.

671
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,022
You laughed in my face
When I said I'd be having sex tonight.

672
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,526
That doesn't mean
you shouldn't always be prepared.

673
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,028
- You didn't even bring a condom?
- No.

674
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,030
No, Evan,
that wasn't part of the plan.

675
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,260
You did this
without consulting with me.

676
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,133
We've never discussed, like, any plan,
but you keep saying we have a plan.

677
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,276
I had, like, a general outline.
You know?

678
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,275
I was gonna go down on her
for, like, several hours, okay?

679
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,381
She would love that. She'd be smitten.
She'd go out with that.

680
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,278
Or I dry hump the shit out of her leg.

681
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,511
Well, I just- I don't see the harm
in bringing one little condom.

682
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,849
And one little bottle
of spermicidal lube?

683
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,492
Yeah, one little bottle
of spermicidal lube.

684
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,492
- Evan, that's psycho shit, man.
- No, it's not.

685
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,324
That's, like, Charles Manson shit.

686
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:50,626
What, do you think Becca's gonna be
psyched that you brought lube?

687
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:54,236
"Oh, Evan. Thank you for bringing
that lube for my pussy.

688
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,533
I never would've been able to handle
your fucking 4-inch dick...

689
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,836
...inside my pussy
without that gigantic bottle of lube. "

690
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,672
- Okay, that's- That's enough.
- Fuck.

691
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,508
These girls are 18,
they're not dried-up old ladies.

692
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,708
- They're good to go.
- Then I won't bring the lube.

693
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,888
Don't make me feel like that.
I thought it was cool.

694
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,387
- This is a nice kind.
- Let me see that for a second.

695
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,582
- An impressive kind.
- It is kind of cool.

696
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,488
- That's cool.
- Fucking dumbass. Lube?

697
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,060
- That's funny.
- You brought lube?

698
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:22,494
You owe me 6 bucks because I'm not
walking over to get it and it exploded.

699
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,397
Hello, Mindy.

700
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,677
I love that stuff.
Been drinking it for years.

701
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:47,421
You know, I heard they recently
decided to add more hops to it.

702
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:52,890
Okay.

703
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,588
I'm gonna need to see
some identification.

704
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,066
Really?

705
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,500
Makes me feel young again.
There you go.

706
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,370
Oh, shit, it's Cary Hutchins.

707
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,015
She had the biggest tits
I've ever seen.

708
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,046
I heard she got
breast-reduction surgery.

709
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,912
What? Making your tits smaller?

710
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,179
That's like slapping God
for giving you a gorgeous gift.

711
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:19,651
She had back problems, man.

712
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,951
And it's not just making them smaller.
They completely reshape them.

713
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:25,095
They make them
more supple and symmetrical.

714
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,763
I gotta catch a glimpse
of these warlocks.

715
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,523
Let's make a move.

716
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,933
- She's going around the corner.
- Come on!

717
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:42,278
Okay. Your total is 96.59.

718
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,485
I don't believe it!

719
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,450
Are you okay, mister?

720
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,388
What the shit was that?

721
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:03,958
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

722
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,801
I don't believe it.

723
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,370
I don't know, man.
I think she looked better before.

724
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,975
But now that she can jog comfortably,
she's in the best shape she's ever-

725
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,110
What is this? What's that?

726
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,114
Oh, man.

727
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,916
Holy shit, they busted Fogell.

728
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,927
How did this happen, Evan?
Fuck, man!

729
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,620
His dad's gonna fucking kill him.

730
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:34,991
Look, okay?

731
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,600
He assaulted the customer,
grabbed the cash and ran out.

732
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:39,770
So...

733
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,598
- How-?
- How-? How-? How-?

734
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:45,207
- Say when, height-wise.
- I'm gonna start up here, tell me when.

735
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,639
- I'll start on the bottom and-
- When.

736
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,870
Whatever 5'10" is,
he was 5'10".

737
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:52,743
Ethnically, I mean, did- what-?

738
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:58,513
I mean, was he-?
Was he like us, or-?

739
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,188
A woman?

740
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,416
- Female?
- No.

741
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,118
- Is that what you're asking?
- No, no. Was he-?

742
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,296
- Like...
- What? What?

743
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,464
- African?
- Af- Af-

744
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,189
- Was he African?
- African.

745
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,459
No. He was American,
and he was like you.

746
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,536
- He looked just like you.
- He was Jewish. Okay, Jew.

747
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:17,230
- It's an odd crime for a Jew.
- They're pretty docile.

748
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:21,036
Okay, so we have an African Jew
wearing a hoodie.

749
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:24,772
No, you don't. No. That's not what
I said. Is that what you heard me say?

750
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,780
I said he looked like you.
Do you look like an African Jew?

751
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,814
- No, I look like a cop.
- Yeah.

752
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,351
He was Caucasian.

753
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,322
- Caucasian.
- All right.

754
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:37,494
- Okay.
- Well, touch.

755
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,027
Kind of looked like Eminem.
Does that help you?

756
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,198
- An M&M.
- An M&M.

757
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:44,095
- So he was circular-?
- Marshall Mathers. Eminem?

758
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:47,499
- The rapper, Eminem.
- Did he look like this?

759
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,530
- I'm an amateur. I kind of-
- That looks like an M&M.

760
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:55,110
Longer face? Bigger nose?
Would you say his mouth was wider?

761
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:56,678
Open? A gap?

762
00:41:56,881 --> 00:42:01,716
Is there another squad car in the area
that could be of further assistance?

763
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,546
I don't seem to be getting any.

764
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:06,655
Okay, so just walk me through again
what this guy did.

765
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,917
He- He- He came in, he's wielding-

766
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:14,393
He's wielding something. He hits
this small gentleman in the slacks.

767
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,625
And then he jumps over you,
he feels you up, violates you.

768
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,496
- I did not say that.
- No, he doesn't.

769
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:23,333
Look, I can't do this. I told you already,
I have an exam tomorrow.

770
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,874
Can you understand that?
I have a goddamn veterinary exam!

771
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:30,209
Goddamn it. This is bullshit.

772
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:33,144
This is some bullshit.
I got an exam tomorrow. Forget this.

773
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,216
Well, apparently someone
has an exam.

774
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,080
How'd you know?

775
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:39,582
You. You're the one
that got punched?

776
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,417
- Yeah.
- Okay.

777
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:43,992
First things first.
What is your name?

778
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,594
My name?

779
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,600
It's M- McLov- McLovin.

780
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:55,672
McLovin?

781
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,238
Yeah.

782
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,799
Now, what's your first name?

783
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,205
What?

784
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,243
- Your first name?
- My first name?

785
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:09,179
Technically I don't have a first name,
so don't worry about my first name.

786
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,415
But we're the police.

787
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,454
We just wanna get
the story straight.

788
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,153
- Come on.
- Fuck, man.

789
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,761
- Come on!
- He must be so afraid.

790
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,933
I don't believe this bullshit.
I can't believe this is happening!

791
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:26,626
I didn't know you could get arrested
for this shit. We need that liquor.

792
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:29,465
- Are they gonna take him downtown?
- Fuck Fogell.

793
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,505
He got arrested, okay?
We're on our own.

794
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,233
We need a new way to get liq-

795
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,039
Fuck! The money, man! Fuck!
How much money can you get?

796
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:39,409
Why are you talking about money?
What about Fogell?

797
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,280
That doesn't matter anymore. I lost
a hundred dollars of Jules' money.

798
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,048
Are we gonna bust him out of jail?
Bake a cake with a fucking file in it?

799
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:51,319
Fuck Fogell. We need a new way to
get liquor, which is fucking impossible.

800
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:54,430
All right, you need to calm down.
We need to think for a second.

801
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,396
- We need to think this out.
- Fuck thinking, we need to act!

802
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:00,965
Seth!

803
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:04,005
- What the fuck happened?
- Just- Just get up. Slowly.

804
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,972
You all right? You okay?

805
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:10,113
I am so sorry, man. I am so sorry.

806
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:14,307
I didn't even effing see you at all, man.
Are you okay?

807
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:17,919
So it's just McLovin?

808
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:19,680
Yeah.

809
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,653
- That's badass.
- That is badass.

810
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,088
- Really cool.
- A badass name.

811
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,991
- Lot of people with weird names.
- Chingy. Shakira.

812
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:28,631
Rafe. Pax.

813
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,961
We arrested a man-lady
who was legally named "Fuck. "

814
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,034
Think he was Vietnamese,
it was with a P-H.

815
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,206
But it's still shocking
to see on a license.

816
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:39,934
- Okay, and how old are you, McLovin?
- Old enough.

817
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,812
Old enough for what?

818
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,182
To party.

819
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,387
Can I see your ID?

820
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,017
Yeah, I think I have it.

821
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,714
- You're an organ donor.
- What?

822
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:25,616
I didn't wanna, but my wife insisted.

823
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,586
I give him shit for it too. All the time.

824
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:30,818
I say, "It's just like a woman.
Even after you're dead...

825
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:34,088
...they wanna tear your heart out. "
- They wanna tear your...

826
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:37,062
- I say it weekly and it's still funny.
- It still makes me laugh.

827
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:38,701
- Really funny.
- There you go.

828
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,997
I'm sorry, guys.
I don't really have any information.

829
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,766
He just hit me,
and I didn't see what he looked like.

830
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:47,341
- I don't know if I can help you.
- You in a hurry?

831
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:49,570
Yeah, kind of had to catch that bus.

832
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,477
- Where were you headed?
- Near 13th and Granville.

833
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:57,083
- We can take you there.
- Get your information on the way.

834
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,552
- Why waste 2 bucks?
- We'll take you. No problem.

835
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,386
Please don't report me, man.
We can figure this out, right?

836
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,188
Why the fuck wouldn't I report you?
You just hit me.

837
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,223
Because I'll do anything.

838
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,925
Please, okay? Anything.
Like, literally...

839
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,570
...fucking anything.

840
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:18,367
Name anything. Name it. Name it.

841
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,207
All right, look. Hey, man. All right.

842
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:23,846
Listen, you can trust me, okay?

843
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:27,279
I'm gonna be totally honest with you.

844
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,119
I have a warrant out
for a totally nonviolent crime.

845
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:35,053
Okay? There. Mercy Street, guys.

846
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,954
I'll be honest with you for a second.

847
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,391
You better get us a shitload of cash
or a shitload of alcohol...

848
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,258
...or you're going to fucking prison.

849
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,558
What are you doing, man?
You don't need to-

850
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,735
No, let's not-
Let's hang on a second here.

851
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:46,994
- Cough it up.
- Fine.

852
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,035
Don't know if we should be
doing anything official.

853
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:52,174
<i>We're working together. It's like
Let's Make a Deal. Here we go.</i>

854
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:54,476
Seven bucks?

855
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:57,738
Are you fucking serious? This isn't
enough. What are you, a 6-year-old?

856
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:01,644
- It's all I have, man. It's all I have.
- You better think of something quickly.

857
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:05,811
- My back! My back. Cops, my back.
- No, no, no. Wait, don't do that.

858
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,287
All right, listen.
I can get you alcohol.

859
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,653
I'm going over to this party
right now, bro. Okay?

860
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:14,797
It's got booze, it's got girls.
Booze and girls equals...

861
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,194
I don't know. Do you?
I don't know. Do you?

862
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:20,336
- I think you do. Do you?
- Yes. That's a definite yes.

863
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:21,505
Definite yes, then.

864
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:24,037
- Give me one sec to talk to him.
- Stay right here.

865
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:27,540
Yeah, yeah. Do what you gotta do.
Mix it over. I'll be over by the car.

866
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:30,714
Just talk it out. Hey, I'm a nice guy.

867
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,642
- Come on, it's great.
- What are you thinking?

868
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,318
- What are you doing?
- What?

869
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,919
I lost Jules' money,
Fogell's dead to us now...

870
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:39,714
...we don't have any choice.
Let's go.

871
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:42,893
I don't like this idea. This guy's
fucking creepy, man. Look at him.

872
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:45,857
What? He looks like a guy.
That's what guys look like.

873
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:48,691
- What is your problem?
- You guys know a guy named Jimmy?

874
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:51,129
You totally look like his brother.

875
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:53,769
You totally
look like his brother, man.

876
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,529
You do.

877
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,038
You promised Becca
you'd get her alcohol.

878
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:01,211
If you don't, she's gonna have
a shitty night.

879
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,380
That's all I'm saying. Come on.

880
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,149
We bingo, bango, ready to go, go?

881
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,275
- Good luck on your exam tomorrow.
- Good luck on your exam.

882
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:12,387
- You don't wanna ride the bus.
- Buses smell like piss, generally.

883
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:13,557
- You know why?
- Why?

884
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,349
People piss on them.

885
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:26,458
You know, one of you bros could've
come up and sat up with me.

886
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,365
- We're fine back here.
- Back's fine.

887
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,506
Safe in the back seat.

888
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:35,036
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

889
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,007
- Hey, Jules.
- Who is it? Who's on the phone?

890
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,683
Seth. Hey, where are you?

891
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:44,342
I'm in a cab right now,
on the way to a liquor store.

892
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:46,352
Good. I can't wait
for you to get here.

893
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:49,082
Well, I hope your friends
are ready to get fucked up.

894
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:51,922
<i>I'm sure they will be.</i>

895
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,324
<i>- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- Peace.</i>

896
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,096
Oh, man! Dude, this is crazy.

897
00:48:57,301 --> 00:49:00,031
She called, she said,
"I can't wait for you to get there. "

898
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,172
That sounds like
she fully wants it, man! Oh, yeah!

899
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:07,868
Who's gonna give it to her, huh,
my man? You, that's who.

900
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,273
Man.

901
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:12,309
You guys on MySpace, or...?

902
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:29,423
Officers? I can answer those
questions now if you want me to.

903
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,659
We get the gist of it. You were
buying beer, some guys punched you.

904
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,065
Don't worry about it.
We're not gonna find them.

905
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,832
- Case closed.
- But it was only-

906
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,711
- But it was only one guy.
- Only one guy? Shit.

907
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,515
How am I supposed to
find one guy?

908
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:58,161
<i>This job really isn't how, you know,
shows like CSI make it out to be.</i>

909
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,991
When I first joined the force, I assumed
there was semen on everything...

910
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,667
...and there was some, like,
huge semen database...

911
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:08,031
...that had every bad guy's semen in it.
There isn't. That doesn't exist.

912
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:11,036
I often go to sleep and dream of
waking up in a world where...

913
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,675
...everything's covered in semen.
- I mean, who doesn't?

914
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:15,845
Lt'd be nice.
Like that crime scene today.

915
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:18,480
If the man had ejaculated
and then punched you...

916
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,309
...we'd have a shot at catching him.

917
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,747
- No way.
- Just punched in the face, no semen.

918
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,444
- No semen.
- Story of my life.

919
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:34,461
Michaels here, he's six months in.

920
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:37,699
He's young,
but the Force is strong with this one.

921
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,301
Learning you are, young padawan.

922
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,096
Thank you very much.

923
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,739
- That's Yoda.
- Are you familiar with Yoda?

924
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:47,433
<i>From Attack of the Clones?</i>

925
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:51,705
<i>We have a 245 at East 24 and
Montgomery, Bailey's Bar and Grill.</i>

926
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:53,883
Car 98 on it.

927
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:57,019
See, Michaels, you always
take a call at a bar because...

928
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,280
...better or worse,
you get a beer out of it.

929
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,282
Pretty sweet, huh?

930
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:03,585
- True that. Amazing thinking.
- Hey, McLovin.

931
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:06,854
We got a situation at Bailey's,
so we'll drop you off after, all right?

932
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,089
Actually, I kind of
have to be somewhere-

933
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:12,359
- Sweet. Sit tight.
- Set course for Bailey's, warp 10.

934
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,900
Engage.

935
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,838
Yeah.

936
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:24,104
Welcome to the Thunderdome.

937
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,878
Hey, man, are you sure it's cool
that we're here with you?

938
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,417
Oh, definitely, man.

939
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:32,589
I'm essentially
best friends with the guy...

940
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,724
...so a bunch of my buds
are coming.

941
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,723
We're gonna rock out
with our cocks out. Just kidding.

942
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,658
- We are gonna rock out.
- Just go, just go.

943
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,832
What's up? What's up? What's up?

944
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:46,467
Hello, hello. Hey, guys.

945
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,381
This is something
a smart person wouldn't do.

946
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,218
Look, just act cool and act casual,
and try and look old.

947
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,088
We'll get the booze
and get the fuck out of here, okay?

948
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:18,160
Hey, where the party at? Right.

949
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:21,132
- You got those shots, bro?
- It's coming.

950
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,629
Come on, let's party.

951
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:27,242
Come on. Do it up.

952
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,244
We should grab one of these buckets
and get out.

953
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,216
You out of your mind? How are we
gonna get a fucking bucket out?

954
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:40,287
- Dude, what the fuck?
- Hey, man.

955
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,287
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

956
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,518
- What are you-? What? Nothing.
- You using my phone?

957
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:49,358
- What do you think you're doing?
- Hang up. Nothing.

958
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,431
What- What-
What's wrong, Mark?

959
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,331
You weren't invited.
Get the fuck out of here.

960
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:57,632
- Come on, Mark. It's cool, man.
- You using my fucking phone?

961
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,638
You calling your
fucking friends again?

962
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,936
You calling your friends,
your fantastic friends?

963
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,045
No. I mean, yes. But I mean I'll-

964
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:06,682
Come on, man, just relax.
Mark, please.

965
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:09,045
Get the fuck out of here.
The fuck out of my house.

966
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:10,720
Get the fuck out of my house.

967
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:14,084
- This is my house.
- Don't be such a dick, man!

968
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:15,857
What the fuck?

969
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,050
Mark! You really wanna do this, man?

970
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:20,856
Here we go.
We're really gonna do this?

971
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,196
That's right, motherfucker.

972
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,565
Come on, pussy. Get up, dude.

973
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:30,835
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, bro.
I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro.

974
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,636
Tiger got out of the cage, man.
All right? I'm sorry. Come on, Mark.

975
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:37,006
Let's just chill.
Everyone just chill out.

976
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:39,414
Truce, man.

977
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,253
Right in the nads!

978
00:53:47,038 --> 00:53:50,599
This is for your friends.
Here, have another one.

979
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:54,006
Shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
Oh, my God. What do we do?

980
00:53:54,212 --> 00:53:55,907
- Come on. Come on.
- Choose one.

981
00:53:57,015 --> 00:54:01,850
- We can slip out the back, man.
- Come on. Let's hurry up and do this.

982
00:54:02,053 --> 00:54:04,146
Are you crazy, man?
Wanna end up like that guy?

983
00:54:04,356 --> 00:54:06,916
Not me. I need my nuts, man,
for a lot of things.

984
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:08,854
- We need liquor.
- You need it. I don't.

985
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,722
I'm gonna tell Becca how I feel.
Maybe she'll get with me.

986
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:14,228
I'm not gonna get her
drunk out of her mind.

987
00:54:14,432 --> 00:54:17,196
Oh, really? Then how come
you never made a move, you pussy?

988
00:54:17,402 --> 00:54:20,769
Because I respect her, Seth. I'm not
gonna put unfair pressure on her.

989
00:54:20,972 --> 00:54:22,963
I don't see a problem.
Let's just do it.

990
00:54:23,174 --> 00:54:25,870
We're leaving, okay?
You wanna get killed for liquor?

991
00:54:26,077 --> 00:54:29,376
No, but I would get killed for pussy,
no questions asked.

992
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:32,709
- Fuck this, man.
- You're just gonna bail on me?

993
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:35,784
- I'm going.
- Fucking bitch.

994
00:54:36,388 --> 00:54:38,686
Move, people.

995
00:54:39,691 --> 00:54:43,320
- Thank you.
- Oh, I love this place.

996
00:54:52,504 --> 00:54:54,131
What the hell is going on in there?

997
00:54:54,339 --> 00:54:56,569
If the bullets start flying,
hit the deck.

998
00:54:56,775 --> 00:54:58,970
You pissed everywhere,
you son of a bitch!

999
00:54:59,177 --> 00:55:02,408
Everywhere? You didn't
see me pissing anywhere.

1000
00:55:02,614 --> 00:55:04,343
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1001
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:06,244
Take your nuts out of your shells!

1002
00:55:06,451 --> 00:55:08,043
Michaels, I got your back.

1003
00:55:08,253 --> 00:55:10,153
Why don't you show this rummy
how we roll?

1004
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:11,652
10-4.

1005
00:55:12,257 --> 00:55:15,249
Excuse me, sir.
Stop what you are doing at once.

1006
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:19,689
- Blue guys!
- Resisting. Resisting!

1007
00:55:19,898 --> 00:55:21,456
- Slater!
- Michaels!

1008
00:55:21,933 --> 00:55:23,161
Everybody stay calm.

1009
00:55:25,036 --> 00:55:28,199
- Everybody stay calm.
- Get the fuck out of my way!

1010
00:55:28,606 --> 00:55:30,369
Stay calm! Fuck!

1011
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:33,209
- Should I shoot him?
- No, no, no!

1012
00:55:33,411 --> 00:55:35,675
- No!
- Stop him, McLovin!

1013
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,610
McLovin, stop him!
Do it, do it, do it, do it!

1014
00:55:43,154 --> 00:55:46,385
Please stop it, you fucking bum.
What the fuck?

1015
00:56:01,072 --> 00:56:04,064
McLovin! Nice!

1016
00:56:04,642 --> 00:56:06,542
He just came at me.
I took him down.

1017
00:56:06,745 --> 00:56:09,270
- I'm buying you a beer, McLovin.
- I'm buying you one too.

1018
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:12,041
Take note. That's how
you take down a motherfucker.

1019
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,615
That's right.

1020
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:16,378
McLovin in the fucking house!

1021
00:56:51,156 --> 00:56:55,490
Hey. You dance hot.

1022
00:56:56,428 --> 00:56:58,123
Thank you.

1023
00:57:13,945 --> 00:57:17,745
Okay, okay. Here we- Here we go.

1024
00:57:18,616 --> 00:57:20,311
<i>- Hello?
- Evan, it's Becca.</i>

1025
00:57:20,518 --> 00:57:22,247
Oh, Becca. Hi.

1026
00:57:22,454 --> 00:57:26,686
Hey. Hello. Hey. Becca.

1027

<i>- Becca-
- Evan, can you hear me?</i>

1028
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:30,818
<i>- Hello? What?
- Can you hear- -? Piece of shit!</i>

1029
00:57:31,029 --> 00:57:33,395
Guy sells me
a piece of shit fucking phone.

1030
00:57:33,598 --> 00:57:35,031
- Becca?
- It's Becca.

1031
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:37,224
<i>I get one bar
everywhere I fucking go.</i>

1032
00:57:37,435 --> 00:57:40,199
<i>- What is he saying?
- Fucking asshole.</i>

1033
00:57:40,405 --> 00:57:42,168
- I think-
- What happened?

1034
00:57:42,373 --> 00:57:43,931
Son-of-a-fucking-bitch
phone company.

1035
00:57:44,142 --> 00:57:46,804
<i>- What? It's rude. Hello?
- Fuck. You suck.</i>

1036
00:57:47,011 --> 00:57:48,638
Bullshit phone. Piece of shit.

1037

<i>I swear I'll bitchslap you
so fucking hard.</i>

1038
00:57:51,382 --> 00:57:52,940
- What?
- Bec-?

1039
00:58:36,995 --> 00:58:38,860
Thanks.

1040
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:42,294
This is fucking crazy.

1041
00:58:51,342 --> 00:58:54,607
Hey. Look what fell out of the truck!

1042
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:57,880
You're full of shit.

1043
00:58:58,082 --> 00:59:00,016
Yeah, I know.

1044
00:59:00,718 --> 00:59:05,314
Dude. Dude.
We're so gonna get fucked up.

1045
00:59:05,523 --> 00:59:07,855
- All right.
- Hey.

1046
00:59:08,393 --> 00:59:10,020
What is that?

1047
00:59:11,396 --> 00:59:13,023
I don't know. What?

1048
00:59:13,231 --> 00:59:16,962
That fucking stain on your pants, idiot.
What is that?

1049
00:59:17,468 --> 00:59:19,561
- What are you talking about, man?
- Dude.

1050
00:59:20,505 --> 00:59:22,939
- Is that blood?
- What the fuck is that?

1051
00:59:23,141 --> 00:59:25,109
- Are you bleeding?
- I'm not cut or anything.

1052
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:28,006
- Why would I be bleeding?
- It's fucking blood, man.

1053
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,842
Were you dancing
with some chick in there?

1054
00:59:32,417 --> 00:59:34,647
- Yeah, so?
- It's blood.

1055
00:59:34,852 --> 00:59:38,379
- Dude, that's not funny.
- It's blood, dude.

1056
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:42,117
But why would I be bleeding?
Why the fuck would I be bl-?

1057
00:59:42,327 --> 00:59:44,090
Dude, why would there be bl-?

1058
00:59:46,397 --> 00:59:49,366
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God.

1059
00:59:51,569 --> 00:59:54,970
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna fucking throw up.

1060
00:59:55,173 --> 00:59:56,697
Someone perioded
on my fucking leg?

1061
00:59:56,908 --> 00:59:58,967
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck do I do?

1062
00:59:59,177 --> 01:00:01,407
I've never before
seen that in my life!

1063
01:00:01,613 --> 01:00:03,274
This is so disgusting.

1064
01:00:03,481 --> 01:00:04,971
- Yes, it is.
- I'm gonna go get Bill.

1065
01:00:05,183 --> 01:00:06,707
- He's gotta check this shit out.
- Fuck, yeah.

1066
01:00:06,918 --> 01:00:10,115
No. Who's Bill? Don't tell Bill!
Bill has nothing to do with this!

1067
01:00:10,321 --> 01:00:12,881
Hey, calm down.
Let me get a picture of that real quick.

1068
01:00:13,091 --> 01:00:14,422
No, you can't have a picture!

1069
01:00:14,626 --> 01:00:16,491
- Dude, stop!
- Bill, Bill! Check it out!

1070
01:00:16,694 --> 01:00:18,594
This kid's got period blood
on his slacks.

1071
01:00:18,796 --> 01:00:20,593
It's merlot.
That's what you don't get.

1072
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:23,426
Hey, Pat! This jerk-off's
got period blood on his pants!

1073
01:00:23,635 --> 01:00:25,603
- Please stop.
- God, man, let me see.

1074
01:00:25,803 --> 01:00:28,738
Oh, my God,
that's a fucking man-gina, man.

1075
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,341
- Do you need a tampon? I could-
- Wait, wait. I have one! I have one!

1076
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:35,002
Yeah, right? I don't know.

1077
01:00:35,213 --> 01:00:38,239
- I gotta wash this off. Is this the line?
- What does it look like?

1078
01:00:38,449 --> 01:00:40,110
Fuck me, right?

1079
01:00:55,366 --> 01:00:57,857
"Yeah, I'm McLovin.
I'd like to buy some-"

1080
01:01:00,071 --> 01:01:01,663
Shit.

1081
01:01:01,873 --> 01:01:04,205
- Rewind, rewind.
- Rewind it. Yeah!

1082
01:01:04,409 --> 01:01:06,434
So hot. Let's see it again.

1083
01:01:08,913 --> 01:01:12,314
- Your legs lifted off the ground.
- That is bona fide badass, man.

1084
01:01:12,517 --> 01:01:14,883
You gotta keep that tape, McLovin.
It is badass.

1085
01:01:15,086 --> 01:01:16,348
- It really is.
- Really?

1086
01:01:16,554 --> 01:01:19,387
Well, don't you guys, like,
need it for, like, evidence or...?

1087
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:22,753
The only thing that's evidence of
is you can take a hit like a champ.

1088
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,655
Seriously. Take that.

1089
01:01:24,862 --> 01:01:29,458
Are there any ladies
we'd like to show this tape to?

1090
01:01:30,234 --> 01:01:33,761
No. You don't wanna meet a chick
in a bar, man. Seriously.

1091
01:01:33,971 --> 01:01:36,599
That was a turning point
in my life, when I realized that.

1092
01:01:36,808 --> 01:01:41,006
You gotta go to other places. You gotta
go to a spin class, a farmers' market...

1093
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:43,908
...pumpkin patch,
given the time of year.

1094
01:01:44,115 --> 01:01:46,583
Just somewhere social,
non-threatening.

1095
01:01:46,784 --> 01:01:50,015
- You know, something like that.
- Yeah, I met the missus at paintball.

1096
01:01:50,221 --> 01:01:53,190
Yeah, I shot her in the neck.
And we just...

1097
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:55,256
And we just hit it off, you know.

1098
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:58,896
My first wife-
Who is a whore, by the way.

1099
01:01:59,097 --> 01:02:00,428
- Where do you think I met her?

1100
01:02:00,631 --> 01:02:03,464
A bar. A bar.

1101
01:02:03,668 --> 01:02:05,659
- It was this bar.
- It was this bar.

1102
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:08,031
Yeah, it was this bar.

1103
01:02:08,306 --> 01:02:12,003
Bought her a Binion's,
complimented her on her tote bag...

1104
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:17,079
...and next thing I know, she's putting
her mouth around the tip of my penis.

1105
01:02:17,882 --> 01:02:19,907
You don't have to tell me that.

1106
01:02:20,118 --> 01:02:22,882
- Right in there.
- She opened up my world, sexually.

1107
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:25,487
On our wedding night,
we had group sex.

1108
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:27,055
I wasn't involved in it.

1109
01:02:27,258 --> 01:02:29,783
- But I could hear it through the wall.
- I was.

1110
01:02:29,994 --> 01:02:32,986
She was amazing. And then it was
exactly 23 months later...

1111
01:02:33,197 --> 01:02:35,222
...that I found out
she was an actual whore.

1112
01:02:35,433 --> 01:02:37,401
- We discovered her on the street.
- Yeah.

1113
01:02:37,602 --> 01:02:39,035
I'm sorry.

1114
01:02:39,237 --> 01:02:41,467
She was bad.
Fucking whoring bitch.

1115
01:02:41,672 --> 01:02:45,108
- But you got a new wife now, so...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1116
01:02:45,309 --> 01:02:47,607
And she is wonderful.

1117
01:02:47,812 --> 01:02:49,780
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You'll meet her.

1118
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:52,142
You know what?
I bet I know your trick, McLovin.

1119
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,682
<i>- You play the whole myst-
- Calling all units.</i>

1120
01:02:54,886 --> 01:02:56,513
Just turn that off.

1121
01:02:56,721 --> 01:02:59,713
<i>Send backup!
There's so much blood- -</i>

1122
01:02:59,924 --> 01:03:03,655
I bet you play the whole
mysterious-guy thing, right?

1123
01:03:04,462 --> 01:03:07,659
Yeah, seriously.
How's it going with the ladies?

1124
01:03:07,932 --> 01:03:11,959
It's not the going with the ladies
I care about...

1125
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:14,968
...it's the coming.

1126
01:03:16,841 --> 01:03:18,809
- I get it.
- What is it? What is it?

1127
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:20,307
Like:

1128
01:03:20,511 --> 01:03:22,172
Like coming.

1129
01:03:25,049 --> 01:03:29,281
- That's funny. That is really funny.
- Oh, my God.

1130
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:37,455
All right, looks like we got a call.
We can't pay for these.

1131
01:03:37,662 --> 01:03:38,959
10-4. We'll be right there.

1132
01:03:39,163 --> 01:03:41,791
- Speedy Gonzales, let's go.
- We should get road beers.

1133
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:44,301
Hell, yeah,
We should get some road beers.

1134
01:03:44,502 --> 01:03:46,663
Can I have 13 beers to go, please?

1135
01:03:46,871 --> 01:03:50,102
Please. God, my fucking leg.

1136
01:04:06,357 --> 01:04:08,018
Fuck.

1137
01:04:34,252 --> 01:04:36,618
- I think it's him.
- Is it him?

1138
01:04:36,821 --> 01:04:38,083
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Becca.</i>

1139
01:04:38,289 --> 01:04:41,986
Hi, I had a bad reception.
So about your Goldslick...

1140
01:04:42,193 --> 01:04:44,889
- Guys, shut up.
- Hey, what's going on over there?

1141
01:04:45,096 --> 01:04:47,155
It's nothing. It's just-

1142
01:04:47,365 --> 01:04:50,232
I was just calling, you know,
to see if you were coming...

1143
01:04:50,434 --> 01:04:53,665
...because I thought maybe you were
stuck at, like, a nightclub...

1144
01:04:53,871 --> 01:04:56,396
...or a cocktail party or something.

1145
01:04:56,607 --> 01:04:59,872
No, no, I'm gonna be there for sure.
Full throttle.

1146
01:05:00,077 --> 01:05:01,772
<i>- Charlie's Angels 2.
- Awesome.</i>

1147
01:05:03,681 --> 01:05:05,979
<i>- I can't wait to see you. Evan?
- Okay, bye.</i>

1148
01:05:06,183 --> 01:05:09,641
That was the first time I ever did coke.
Off that bitch's nipple. That was so-

1149
01:05:09,854 --> 01:05:11,583
- A little white sniff.
- That was awesome.

1150
01:05:11,789 --> 01:05:12,756
That was gorgeous.

1151
01:05:12,957 --> 01:05:16,222
Hey, hey, hey.
You guys, stay in this room, man.

1152
01:05:16,427 --> 01:05:19,624
They're gonna kill that guy tonight.
That chick's boyfriend is pissed.

1153
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:21,354
Yeah. He's a beast.

1154
01:05:21,565 --> 01:05:24,591
I've been praying for a fight.
I'm literally waking up and praying...

1155
01:05:24,802 --> 01:05:26,736
...to see a fucking fight.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1156
01:05:28,973 --> 01:05:30,133
Who's that guy?

1157
01:05:35,179 --> 01:05:36,168
- Hi.
- Who is that guy?

1158
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:38,405
- Who's this guy?
- Pleasure to see you fellas.

1159
01:05:38,616 --> 01:05:39,674
Hi, everyone.

1160
01:05:39,884 --> 01:05:41,545
- Who are you?
- I'm nobody.

1161
01:05:41,752 --> 01:05:43,310
No, no, no. I know you. I know you.

1162
01:05:43,521 --> 01:05:45,751
He was at that party
I was telling you about.

1163
01:05:45,957 --> 01:05:47,117
- No, no.
- Who is it?

1164
01:05:47,325 --> 01:05:50,453
Remember? He's Jimmy's brother.
The guy. The singer.

1165
01:05:50,895 --> 01:05:53,295
- No.
- He's the guy with the beautiful voice.

1166
01:05:53,497 --> 01:05:56,057
- The fucking singer, Jimmy's brother!
- That's not me, man.

1167
01:05:56,267 --> 01:05:57,996
- Oh, my God.
- Sing for us! Sing.

1168
01:05:58,202 --> 01:05:59,669
"It's not me"? You fucking lying?

1169
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:02,964
No, I don't mean to accuse you guys
of being ill-informed, but-

1170
01:06:03,174 --> 01:06:05,540
My brother came from Scottsdale,
Arizona to be here.

1171
01:06:05,743 --> 01:06:07,108
You're not gonna sing for him?

1172
01:06:07,311 --> 01:06:08,471
- Fucking bullshit.
- Sing.

1173
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:10,840
- You're a fucking singer.
- You sing good.

1174
01:06:11,048 --> 01:06:12,515
- Sing it again.
- Like a bird.

1175
01:06:12,717 --> 01:06:15,379
- No, I know, I just- I want to.
- You want a line of cocaine?

1176
01:06:15,586 --> 01:06:16,678
- No way, man.
- Yeah.

1177
01:06:16,887 --> 01:06:19,048
Don't make this weird. Sing.

1178
01:06:19,256 --> 01:06:21,417
- Sing it again.
- Turbo.

1179
01:06:25,796 --> 01:06:27,821
- Fuck! Over!
- Okay, watch this.

1180
01:06:28,032 --> 01:06:30,865
I'll get it right on the nose.

1181
01:06:31,068 --> 01:06:33,298
You're gonna fuck it up.
You're gonna fuck it up.

1182
01:06:33,504 --> 01:06:35,335
Under!

1183
01:06:35,539 --> 01:06:37,734
I feel hammered.
That doesn't make any sense.

1184
01:06:37,942 --> 01:06:40,536
- You're a fucking pussy.
- Okay, okay. Great, great.

1185
01:06:40,745 --> 01:06:44,203
- Okay, McLovin, see if you can do it.
- The kid's gonna nail it.

1186
01:06:44,415 --> 01:06:47,282
Come on, McLovin.
Do it, buddy. Come on, buddy!

1187
01:06:47,485 --> 01:06:50,079
- Bring it!
- 0.08, motherfuckers!

1188
01:06:50,287 --> 01:06:52,949
- Man!
- That's my boy!

1189
01:06:53,357 --> 01:06:55,291
- Yes!
- Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck.

1190
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,958
So, what's it like to have guns?

1191
01:06:59,163 --> 01:07:01,859
It is awesome, McLovin.

1192
01:07:02,066 --> 01:07:03,727
- I mean, it's mindbl-
- It's great.

1193
01:07:03,934 --> 01:07:06,664
I haven't had one for long,
a few months, but I'll tell you...

1194
01:07:06,871 --> 01:07:08,634
...it's like having two cocks.
- Yup.

1195
01:07:08,839 --> 01:07:11,672
If one of your cocks
could kill someone.

1196
01:07:12,777 --> 01:07:15,337
- Can I hold one?
- What?

1197
01:07:15,546 --> 01:07:16,843
Can I hold one of your guns?

1198
01:07:20,117 --> 01:07:23,177
- Yeah, sure.
- Fine with me. Why not?

1199
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:25,685
Everyone should hold a gun
at least a couple times.

1200
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,323
Yeah, there you go.

1201
01:07:27,525 --> 01:07:29,857
- Have a blast.
- "Have a blast. "

1202
01:07:30,061 --> 01:07:34,225
- That's funny.
- I've never held one of these before.

1203
01:07:34,432 --> 01:07:37,162
- Are they hard to shoot?
- Lf you're Michaels, they are.

1204
01:07:37,368 --> 01:07:39,063
- He can't shoot worth dick.
- What?

1205
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:40,760
I can shoot. What are you-? Wait.

1206
01:07:40,971 --> 01:07:43,269
- I can't shoot worth dick?
- You cannot shoot.

1207
01:07:43,474 --> 01:07:45,908
- I shot that cat last week.
- It was already dead, man.

1208
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:47,668
- I still shot it.
- That cat was dead.

1209
01:07:47,878 --> 01:07:49,743
There's only one way
to settle this, guys.

1210
01:07:50,314 --> 01:07:51,804
- Shoot-off.
- Shoot-off.

1211
01:07:52,016 --> 01:07:54,849
- Shoot-off!
- Shoot-off!

1212
01:07:55,052 --> 01:07:56,747
There's a lot of reasons
why I like you.

1213
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:59,252
I mean, you're handsome
and you're a good friend.

1214
01:07:59,457 --> 01:08:03,484
Dude, there he is. That's the guy.
Hey, Mark, right there.

1215
01:08:05,396 --> 01:08:06,420
Oh, you got a stain too.

1216
01:08:08,265 --> 01:08:10,426
- We're blood brothers.
- Shut the fuck up.

1217
01:08:10,634 --> 01:08:13,159
You're in my house,
you answer my questions.

1218
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:15,270
What were you doing
dancing with Jacinda?

1219
01:08:17,975 --> 01:08:19,237
I don't even dance. I just-

1220
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:21,968
I don't even dance ever, so-
I've never even tried it.

1221
01:08:22,179 --> 01:08:24,841
Then where the hell did this
come from, asshole?

1222
01:08:26,317 --> 01:08:28,842
Maybe you and I rubbed up against
each other at some point.

1223
01:08:29,053 --> 01:08:32,022
I don't remember. Maybe it was
some ricochet scenario. I don't know.

1224
01:08:32,223 --> 01:08:34,248
- How am I supposed to know?
- Kick his ass, Mark.

1225
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:36,221
Shut the fuck up, Scarlett.

1226
01:08:37,094 --> 01:08:39,790
Where do you get off
dancing with my fiance?

1227
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:49,297
To some girl.

1228
01:09:02,686 --> 01:09:04,017
Talk about the hurting.

1229
01:09:14,265 --> 01:09:15,698
- Shit.
- All right.

1230
01:09:38,689 --> 01:09:40,350
- Yo! Fight!
- Move it!

1231
01:09:40,558 --> 01:09:42,287
- Go, check this out!
- Oh, fuck!

1232
01:09:42,493 --> 01:09:44,461
And what the hell is this?

1233
01:09:44,962 --> 01:09:48,261
- I don't fucking- It's detergent.
- Yeah, what are you doing with it?

1234
01:09:50,034 --> 01:09:53,060
I got fucking blood on my pants.

1235
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,794
Get down.

1236
01:09:56,807 --> 01:09:59,241
What the fuck is this all about, man?
Are you-?

1237
01:10:00,277 --> 01:10:03,610
- Well, fuck me.
- Fellas.

1238
01:10:04,181 --> 01:10:07,150
Oh, shit,
I've been tackled by little girls!

1239
01:10:07,351 --> 01:10:08,443
You die! You're next!

1240
01:10:11,188 --> 01:10:15,955
I should fucking kill you,
you motherfucker!

1241
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:20,119
- Hold him, Jimmy's brother! Hold him!
- What do you mean? No. No way!

1242
01:10:20,331 --> 01:10:22,060
- You humiliated me!
- I'm sorry!

1243
01:10:22,266 --> 01:10:25,827
- You used my leg as a tampon!
- I'm calling the cops.

1244
01:10:26,036 --> 01:10:30,735
Evan! Come on! Move!

1245
01:10:30,975 --> 01:10:33,603
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1246
01:10:33,811 --> 01:10:37,975
Yeah. Fifth and Paysview. Hurry.

1247
01:10:38,182 --> 01:10:40,912
Mark, I called the cops.
You should hide your gun.

1248
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,743
You're a fucking pussy.

1249
01:10:42,953 --> 01:10:44,181
Don't listen to him, officer.

1250
01:10:44,388 --> 01:10:46,822
If you make this,
we're no longer friends, Michaels.

1251
01:10:47,057 --> 01:10:49,457
- You're a fucking pussy.
- Cheating. You're cheating.

1252
01:10:50,594 --> 01:10:55,258
- Fuck me.
- Oh, suck on my nuts, Slater!

1253
01:10:55,466 --> 01:10:57,297
All right, you-
That was a lucky shot.

1254
01:10:57,501 --> 01:11:00,664
- That was a lucky shot.
- I rule.

1255
01:11:00,871 --> 01:11:02,099
I got jizzed on. All right.

1256
01:11:02,339 --> 01:11:04,364
- Can I shoot one?
- Yeah, go nuts. Go nuts.

1257
01:11:04,575 --> 01:11:06,042
Have a good time, man.

1258
01:11:06,243 --> 01:11:09,144
Empty the clip.
Empty the clip on it, man. Shit!

1259
01:11:09,346 --> 01:11:13,305
The cops! Bail! Bail! Bail!
Shotgun, shotgun! Damn it!

1260
01:11:14,752 --> 01:11:16,117
Shotgun.

1261
01:11:25,529 --> 01:11:28,089
- What a rush.
- What do you guys wanna do?

1262
01:11:28,299 --> 01:11:30,733
- Man, let's get drunk!
- Let's get more fucked up!

1263
01:11:30,934 --> 01:11:33,027
You're fucking living the dream,
Michaels!

1264
01:11:33,237 --> 01:11:34,204
Oh, man.

1265
01:11:34,405 --> 01:11:36,134
This is gonna be the best night ever.

1266
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:38,774
<i>- Got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview.
- Shit.</i>

1267
01:11:38,976 --> 01:11:41,342
<i>All units in the area report
to Fifth and Paysview.</i>

1268
01:11:41,545 --> 01:11:43,843
<i>- Car 98, that's you. Do it.
- Fuck.</i>

1269
01:11:44,048 --> 01:11:46,107
- Shit.
- Shit.

1270
01:11:46,317 --> 01:11:49,582
Car 98 on it.
You dumb fucking whore.

1271
01:11:49,787 --> 01:11:52,779
Hey, did she say we're gonna get
to shoot somebody or something?

1272
01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:54,287
Oh, God, I wish.

1273
01:11:54,525 --> 01:11:57,892
It's probably some lame house party.
We'll drop you off after. Cool?

1274
01:11:58,128 --> 01:12:00,392
Yeah, man.
Let's show these fuckers how we roll!

1275
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:18,708
- You fucking prick.
- What?

1276
01:12:21,652 --> 01:12:25,588
- You bailed on me.
- I didn't bail on you.

1277
01:12:25,789 --> 01:12:27,848
Yeah, you did.

1278
01:12:28,058 --> 01:12:30,891
You said you were gonna
do something and you didn't do it.

1279
01:12:31,095 --> 01:12:32,221
That's bailing.

1280
01:12:32,429 --> 01:12:35,660
You're the one that dragged me to
that fucking party with those lunatics.

1281
01:12:35,866 --> 01:12:40,826
- I didn't bail on you.
- You bailed on me, okay?

1282
01:12:41,038 --> 01:12:43,438
You bailed on me this morning
when Jesse spat on me...

1283
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,267
...and you're bailing on me
next year.

1284
01:12:45,476 --> 01:12:48,536
What the fuck? It finally comes out.
That's good, man.

1285
01:12:48,746 --> 01:12:50,680
We were supposed to go
to college together.

1286
01:12:50,914 --> 01:12:52,973
Since we were kids,
since elementary school...

1287
01:12:53,183 --> 01:12:55,617
...that's all we've ever talked about,
us going together.

1288
01:12:55,819 --> 01:12:57,446
And you got into
fucking Dartmouth.

1289
01:12:57,654 --> 01:12:59,645
You're making me feel
like I'm a bad guy.

1290
01:12:59,857 --> 01:13:02,792
What-? I didn't do anything wrong.
I got into a good school.

1291
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,723
How the fuck am I supposed to get
into Dartmouth? You knew I couldn't.

1292
01:13:06,964 --> 01:13:08,431
How fucking selfish are you?

1293
01:13:08,632 --> 01:13:10,657
You had no problem letting Fogell
take the fall.

1294
01:13:10,868 --> 01:13:12,836
You don't want me going
to a good school.

1295
01:13:13,036 --> 01:13:15,027
- Fuck, man!
- So, what the fuck do you want?

1296
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:17,764
I'm not gonna let you
slow me down anymore, Seth.

1297
01:13:20,944 --> 01:13:22,002
What are you saying?

1298
01:13:22,746 --> 01:13:26,443
I've wasted the last three years
sitting around talking bullshit with you.

1299
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:28,618
Instead of chasing girls
and making friends...

1300
01:13:28,819 --> 01:13:31,811
...I've just sat around
wasting all my time with you.

1301
01:13:32,022 --> 01:13:34,616
And now I'm going to college
a fucking friendless virgin.

1302
01:13:34,858 --> 01:13:38,316
Is this about Becca?
This is about some girl, man?

1303
01:13:38,529 --> 01:13:39,962
- I like her!
- Who gives a fuck?

1304
01:13:40,164 --> 01:13:42,325
She's some fucking girl!
You gonna go out with her?

1305
01:13:42,533 --> 01:13:45,024
- What about after that?
- Fuck you, you're a piece of shit.

1306
01:13:45,536 --> 01:13:48,300
Fuck you! And next time
you're pissed off about something...

1307
01:13:48,505 --> 01:13:51,338
...don't keep it inside for 10 years,
say it like a fucking man!

1308
01:13:51,542 --> 01:13:52,509
- Don't touch me.
- Fuck you!

1309
01:13:55,045 --> 01:13:57,980
Hey, McLovin, are the numbers
on your side odd or even?

1310
01:13:58,182 --> 01:14:01,913
- I don't know. It's too dark to see.
- We got flashlights.

1311
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:03,882
Oh, that's true.

1312
01:14:09,593 --> 01:14:11,458
Where the fuck are we?

1313
01:14:12,329 --> 01:14:14,297
- Hey, Slater.
- What's that?

1314
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:16,260
Slater.

1315
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:23,299
Now, young Michaels, you will die.

1316
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:28,208
All right. Come on, stop it.
I can't fucking see. I can't see. Fuck it.

1317
01:14:28,412 --> 01:14:30,209
- Like it?
- Hey, fuck off, that hurts.

1318
01:14:30,414 --> 01:14:32,143
- You stop first.
- Not until you stop.

1319
01:14:32,349 --> 01:14:33,976
- Stop it, asshole.
- Hey, you stop.

1320
01:14:35,052 --> 01:14:37,077
- Fuck you, Evan!
- Don't fucking touch me.

1321
01:14:48,999 --> 01:14:50,091
Why did you do that?

1322
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:52,461
- You shined the light in my face.
- You did too.

1323
01:14:52,669 --> 01:14:54,694
- I'm driving.
- We were playing Lightsabers.

1324
01:14:54,905 --> 01:14:56,930
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God.

1325
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:59,540
Are you guys gonna make sure
he's okay?

1326
01:15:02,779 --> 01:15:04,041
- Check on him.
- You check.

1327
01:15:04,248 --> 01:15:07,706
- You go out there and check on him.
- Fuck that. You go.

1328
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:12,252
Balls. Okay, we'll both go out there
and check on him.

1329
01:15:13,724 --> 01:15:16,591
I can't believe this is happening again.
What are the odds?

1330
01:15:17,127 --> 01:15:18,754
Fuck.

1331
01:15:22,766 --> 01:15:26,463
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah, we're great, thanks.

1332
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:31,130
Hey, hey, where's the love?

1333
01:15:31,341 --> 01:15:35,801
- He's okay. He's fine.
- Stand right next to your friend.

1334
01:15:36,013 --> 01:15:37,844
- Get over there.
- I got them.

1335
01:15:38,048 --> 01:15:39,379
You got these guys?

1336
01:15:46,223 --> 01:15:48,088
You boys doing
a bit of drinking tonight?

1337
01:15:48,292 --> 01:15:52,422
- No, officer. Not at all. Not- we-
- We found those.

1338
01:15:52,629 --> 01:15:53,755
I don't believe you.

1339
01:15:57,434 --> 01:15:59,595
Freeze. Stand right there.

1340
01:15:59,803 --> 01:16:01,862
- We're telling the truth.
- Keep it going.

1341
01:16:02,072 --> 01:16:04,404
- Don't be a hero tonight, guys.
- Wrong night for that.

1342
01:16:04,608 --> 01:16:06,166
You gotta fucking take care of this.

1343
01:16:06,376 --> 01:16:10,437
No. Look, I am not fixing your mistakes
again, okay? Fuck that shit.

1344
01:16:10,647 --> 01:16:12,945
I don't wanna get shitcanned.
I like this job.

1345
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:15,414
Me too. I get free haircuts.
I'm not taking the fall.

1346
01:16:15,619 --> 01:16:17,246
Okay, okay!

1347
01:16:18,255 --> 01:16:20,416
We're gonna arrest
these two little dipshits, okay?

1348
01:16:20,624 --> 01:16:22,353
And we're gonna pin it on them.

1349
01:16:23,026 --> 01:16:24,493
Yeah, do what you have to do.

1350
01:16:30,968 --> 01:16:32,026
Spread your shit!

1351
01:16:32,235 --> 01:16:35,261
Get on the ground!
Loaded gun, ready to go!

1352
01:16:35,472 --> 01:16:38,066
Spread your shit!
Pussies on the pavement, fellas.

1353
01:16:38,275 --> 01:16:40,470
- Come on!
- Please don't shoot, sir.

1354
01:16:40,677 --> 01:16:43,271
"Please don't shoot. "
Shut up and spread your shit!

1355
01:16:44,848 --> 01:16:47,749
I am the law! Okay?

1356
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:49,077
Now hold hands.

1357
01:16:49,286 --> 01:16:50,685
- What?
- Why?

1358
01:16:50,887 --> 01:16:54,482
You don't want an asshole where your
face used to be, Whaling Jennings.

1359
01:16:54,691 --> 01:16:57,091
- Hold his fucking hand!
- Fucking hold my hand.

1360
01:16:57,294 --> 01:16:59,660
There. That's not so hard, is it?

1361
01:16:59,863 --> 01:17:02,297
Here, McLovin, have a cigarette.

1362
01:17:03,533 --> 01:17:05,296
Smoke up. Life's short, you know.

1363
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:08,060
Suck it in, my friend.

1364
01:17:08,271 --> 01:17:10,831
Suck it long and deep.

1365
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:12,531
Enjoy it.

1366
01:17:13,143 --> 01:17:15,703
McLovin, McLovin, McLovin.

1367
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:22,413
- You like Officer Slater and myself?
- Yeah, you guys are awesome.

1368
01:17:22,619 --> 01:17:25,747
Thanks.
We really like you too, McLovin.

1369
01:17:25,956 --> 01:17:27,514
So here's what's about to happen.

1370
01:17:27,724 --> 01:17:29,157
We're gonna arrest these guys...

1371
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:32,920
...you're gonna write a witness report
saying they leapt in front of our car...

1372
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:35,462
...and there was nothing we could do.
Sound cool?

1373
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:39,634
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Good.

1374
01:17:39,836 --> 01:17:42,134
That's good.
Pretend he's your little sister.

1375
01:17:42,339 --> 01:17:44,330
Your little sister with the...

1376
01:17:55,218 --> 01:17:56,242
What the fuck?

1377
01:18:08,632 --> 01:18:10,156
Fagell?

1378
01:18:19,476 --> 01:18:21,467
- Shit!
- Shit!

1379
01:18:25,482 --> 01:18:26,847
Run! Run!

1380
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:28,278
Wait.

1381
01:18:28,485 --> 01:18:31,886
Hold on, I gotta get all the booze.
Seth, wait up!

1382
01:18:32,089 --> 01:18:33,750
McLovin bailed!

1383
01:18:33,957 --> 01:18:36,016
Chase the kid!

1384
01:18:43,633 --> 01:18:44,725
Stop!

1385
01:19:05,655 --> 01:19:07,782
That was a fast kid.

1386
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:14,897
I want a ride! You hear me?
You can't unarrest me!

1387
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,890
Stop!

1388
01:19:21,037 --> 01:19:24,939
- McLovin!
- Come on.

1389
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:28,070
McLovin!

1390
01:19:28,812 --> 01:19:31,576
McLovin! Why?

1391
01:19:33,517 --> 01:19:34,575
McLovin, come back!

1392
01:19:36,486 --> 01:19:41,480
My hand! Monster!
Nicole! Nicole, get Daddy.

1393
01:19:41,691 --> 01:19:44,182
- Get Daddy.
- Get Daddy!

1394
01:19:44,394 --> 01:19:46,988
- Oh, shit.
- Get away from my kids!

1395
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:52,461
You sick sons of bitches!

1396
01:19:55,472 --> 01:19:56,962
What the fuck?

1397
01:20:02,746 --> 01:20:05,180
Michaels, are you okay?

1398
01:20:05,415 --> 01:20:07,178
- It's just beer.
- Give me a break.

1399
01:20:07,384 --> 01:20:08,976
- It's just beer.
- Man up.

1400
01:20:09,186 --> 01:20:10,778
What happened?
What, did you lose him?

1401
01:20:10,987 --> 01:20:13,751
He's a freak.
He's the fastest kid alive.

1402
01:20:13,957 --> 01:20:16,482
- This is not good.
- He's the fastest kid alive.

1403
01:20:16,726 --> 01:20:19,752
Fastest kid alive, my ass. Come on.
What are we gonna do?

1404
01:20:20,063 --> 01:20:21,963
I'll shoot my gun in the air.

1405
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:24,133
Give me a fucking warning
before you do it.

1406
01:20:24,334 --> 01:20:26,302
I'll scare him out of wherever
he's hiding.

1407
01:20:26,503 --> 01:20:29,165
This isn't gonna do shit.
Get in the car. Get in the car.

1408
01:20:29,372 --> 01:20:31,203
This is your fault, you piece of-

1409
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:34,141
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
They shot Seth.

1410
01:20:34,344 --> 01:20:36,471
They fucking shot Seth, I know it.

1411
01:20:37,214 --> 01:20:38,442
Holy shit.

1412
01:20:38,648 --> 01:20:39,637
Holy shit. Holy shit.

1413
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:42,343
- Should I run?
- Yes.

1414
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:49,183
- Fuck. Stop!
- Stop the bus!

1415
01:20:49,392 --> 01:20:50,825
- Stop it!
- It's stopping.

1416
01:20:51,027 --> 01:20:53,188
- It's stopping.
- Oh, thank God.

1417
01:20:55,966 --> 01:20:58,196
Hey, Evan, pay for me, please.

1418
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:01,537
That's me and him.

1419
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:06,166
Hey, hey. It's you.

1420
01:21:06,376 --> 01:21:07,604
McMuffin.

1421
01:21:08,011 --> 01:21:09,376
- You know this guy?
- It's-

1422
01:21:09,579 --> 01:21:13,606
Ain't got no cop people to help you
keep your booze now, do you?

1423
01:21:13,817 --> 01:21:17,150
Hey! Back the fuck up, man,
or I'll beat the shit out of you.

1424
01:21:17,354 --> 01:21:19,413
<i>- Give me the booze.
- Hey! Back the fuck up.</i>

1425
01:21:19,623 --> 01:21:22,820
<i>Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.</i>

1426
01:21:23,026 --> 01:21:24,687
Please, please, calm down, sir.

1427
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:39,206
Goldslick.

1428
01:21:50,654 --> 01:21:52,747
Get off the bus
or I'm calling the cops.

1429
01:21:59,462 --> 01:22:01,521
Eat shit, bum.

1430
01:22:01,898 --> 01:22:03,991
Oh, shit, guys.
We're three blocks away, man.

1431
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,600
We made it. We made it
with the booze and everything.

1432
01:22:06,803 --> 01:22:08,134
We made it.

1433
01:22:08,338 --> 01:22:09,771
Hold this.

1434
01:22:10,507 --> 01:22:13,032
I can't believe
you still have the liquor.

1435
01:22:14,077 --> 01:22:15,135
It's awesome.

1436
01:22:15,345 --> 01:22:18,405
Yeah, I told you the idea would work.
I fooled those cops.

1437
01:22:18,648 --> 01:22:21,617
I'm McLovin. I am McLovin.

1438
01:22:23,486 --> 01:22:24,885
Why do you guys have detergent?

1439
01:22:25,088 --> 01:22:28,057
I don't understand why you were
smoking cigarettes with those cops.

1440
01:22:28,258 --> 01:22:29,885
Because I fucking rule.

1441
01:22:30,093 --> 01:22:33,392
- we are so gonna get laid tonight.
- I am. I'm gonna get laid.

1442
01:22:33,596 --> 01:22:35,996
we're finally gonna
get our drinks on.

1443
01:22:38,168 --> 01:22:39,863
I can't believe Becca's bottle broke.

1444
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:41,435
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- Yeah.

1445
01:22:41,638 --> 01:22:44,539
I thought you didn't need it.
You were gonna tell her how you feel.

1446
01:22:44,741 --> 01:22:47,266
Good luck getting Jules drunk enough
to have sex with you.

1447
01:22:47,477 --> 01:22:49,411
- what's wrong with you guys?
- Nothing.

1448
01:22:49,612 --> 01:22:52,775
You two femmes can talk about it
next year at your little slumber party.

1449
01:22:52,983 --> 01:22:54,678
Oh, you told him.

1450
01:22:54,884 --> 01:22:57,512
- Told me what?
- Yeah. You're an idiot, Fogell.

1451
01:22:57,721 --> 01:22:59,518
- well, we gotta tell him now.
- No, we-

1452
01:22:59,723 --> 01:23:01,190
well, he knows something's up.

1453
01:23:01,424 --> 01:23:03,688
what are you guys talking about?
Tell me now.

1454
01:23:03,927 --> 01:23:06,088
Seth, me and Evan are
rooming together next year.

1455
01:23:06,296 --> 01:23:07,285
what's the big deal?

1456
01:23:07,497 --> 01:23:09,431
"Oh, my God,
Fogell's rooming with Evan. "

1457
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:11,327
Jeez, why don't you go cry about it?

1458
01:23:11,534 --> 01:23:13,968
- I didn't tell you because-
- You're a backstabber...

1459
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:17,401
...and you lied to your best friend
and you just don't care anymore?

1460
01:23:17,607 --> 01:23:19,802
I didn't expect this from you, Evan.

1461
01:23:20,276 --> 01:23:21,436
Not from you.

1462
01:23:21,644 --> 01:23:23,839
Give me that booze, Fagell.

1463
01:23:27,417 --> 01:23:30,386
we never should have had to hide
our arrangement.

1464
01:23:40,563 --> 01:23:42,895
- Seth's here.
- Seth, you're here.

1465
01:23:43,099 --> 01:23:46,830
Hi. Everybody, Seth has got it.

1466
01:24:10,093 --> 01:24:12,220
- Evan.
- Gaby, hey.

1467
01:24:12,429 --> 01:24:14,294
where have you been?
You almost blew it.

1468
01:24:14,497 --> 01:24:17,022
- what are you talking about?
- Becca. She's been waiting.

1469
01:24:17,233 --> 01:24:18,530
She's over there.

1470
01:24:19,402 --> 01:24:20,699
She's way smashed.

1471
01:24:20,904 --> 01:24:23,202
And she's been yammering
about you all night.

1472
01:24:23,406 --> 01:24:25,203
Really? what was she saying?

1473
01:24:25,408 --> 01:24:27,501
She told you that she thinks
I'm a good guy?

1474
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:30,270
No, no.
She said something more like:

1475
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,005
"I will fully blow him tonight. "

1476
01:24:33,249 --> 01:24:35,581
- what?
- I know.

1477
01:24:39,022 --> 01:24:41,252
- Yeah.
- But she's totally hammered...

1478
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:44,359
...and if I get with her
and I'm not drunk, isn't that unethical?

1479
01:24:45,195 --> 01:24:46,594
Not if you're drunk too.

1480
01:24:47,931 --> 01:24:49,296
I guess not.

1481
01:24:49,499 --> 01:24:50,830
To Seth.

1482
01:24:51,034 --> 01:24:53,229
- To Seth!
- All right.

1483
01:24:53,436 --> 01:24:55,301
who the fuck is Seth?

1484
01:24:55,505 --> 01:24:57,200
I'm Seth!

1485
01:24:58,908 --> 01:25:01,138
Let's do another one to me.

1486
01:25:12,188 --> 01:25:13,780
Oh, boy.

1487
01:25:14,524 --> 01:25:16,583
Calm down. Calm down, man.

1488
01:25:16,793 --> 01:25:18,852
Calm down. She likes you.

1489
01:25:19,229 --> 01:25:21,459
She wants to suck on your penis.

1490
01:25:21,698 --> 01:25:23,325
It's a good thing.

1491
01:25:23,533 --> 01:25:27,196
It's the best thing.

1492
01:25:28,004 --> 01:25:29,665
Just down the hatch.

1493
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,400
Fogell. what's up?

1494
01:26:46,382 --> 01:26:48,680
Evan, hey. Evie, come here.

1495
01:26:48,885 --> 01:26:50,284
Can you please help me up?

1496
01:26:50,486 --> 01:26:54,047
I fell down and none of these assholes
will help me up.

1497
01:26:54,257 --> 01:26:56,817
- Shit.
- Becca.

1498
01:26:57,026 --> 01:26:59,119
I have been waiting for you
for, like, ever.

1499
01:26:59,329 --> 01:27:01,297
- what took you so long?
- I know, it-

1500
01:27:01,497 --> 01:27:03,931
- Do you have my Goldslick?
- No, I can't even-

1501
01:27:04,133 --> 01:27:05,794
It's such a crazy story, okay?

1502
01:27:06,002 --> 01:27:09,301
- I swear I was try-
- It doesn't even matter.

1503
01:27:09,505 --> 01:27:11,996
Look. Look what we-
we can just drink this.

1504
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:14,472
- Here. You could have a drink.
- Oh, no.

1505
01:27:14,677 --> 01:27:16,668
- I'm already pretty wasted.
- Take a drink.

1506
01:27:16,879 --> 01:27:19,245
Okay, here's to you.
This is to Becca.

1507
01:27:19,449 --> 01:27:20,541
To Becca.

1508
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,082
- To the respecting-
- Guys.

1509
01:27:23,286 --> 01:27:26,346
- women.
To people respecting women.

1510
01:27:26,556 --> 01:27:29,548
Okay. Yeah.

1511
01:27:31,995 --> 01:27:33,223
You're a lightweight.

1512
01:27:34,597 --> 01:27:35,962
Hey.

1513
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,265
You and me,
we should go upstairs, because-

1514
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:44,600
Because I need to
tell you something. Okay?

1515
01:27:45,174 --> 01:27:47,335
You could just tell me here,
I mean...

1516
01:27:47,543 --> 01:27:52,276
I can't tell you, because
it's a secret for you from me.

1517
01:27:52,482 --> 01:27:54,541
- All right.
- So come. Come on. Okay.

1518
01:27:54,751 --> 01:27:55,911
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

1519
01:27:56,119 --> 01:27:58,314
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1520
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,025
You changed your name
to McLovin?

1521
01:28:08,898 --> 01:28:11,526
- That's so cool.
- Thanks.

1522
01:28:11,734 --> 01:28:15,602
So, like, what's Hawaii like?

1523
01:28:16,272 --> 01:28:17,637
All right. I am back.

1524
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,104
I had to thank the peeps
for coming out, you know.

1525
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:22,801
Jules. I want you
to have a drink with me.

1526
01:28:23,012 --> 01:28:25,378
Just drink some of this.
You're gonna love it.

1527
01:28:25,581 --> 01:28:27,378
You're to-
I know you're gonna love it.

1528
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:31,144
- You know, I-
- It's green beer. For your information.

1529
01:28:31,354 --> 01:28:33,982
You know, I'm actually good
right now. But thank you.

1530
01:28:34,457 --> 01:28:37,688
And thank you very much
for bringing everything, again.

1531
01:28:37,894 --> 01:28:39,521
Seriously, it really made the night.

1532
01:28:39,729 --> 01:28:42,493
No, that's how I roll.
That's the thing.

1533
01:28:42,699 --> 01:28:45,532
It's no problems. You'll learn that.

1534
01:28:51,341 --> 01:28:55,971
I love talking
and conversing with you.

1535
01:28:56,179 --> 01:28:59,171
But I can't hear you, though,
because the music is so loud.

1536
01:28:59,382 --> 01:29:02,545
So do you wanna go outside
and talk more?

1537
01:29:05,421 --> 01:29:08,049
Yeah. Sorry, sure.
You know, why not?

1538
01:29:08,257 --> 01:29:10,225
Let's do it.
I haven't conversed in ages.

1539
01:29:10,426 --> 01:29:13,884
- Okay. Ladies- Ladies first.
- Okay.

1540
01:29:14,964 --> 01:29:16,932
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

1541
01:29:17,133 --> 01:29:19,533
- watch your step. I fell earlier today.
- You serious?

1542
01:29:19,736 --> 01:29:21,829
well, I was hit by a car.
It's a long story.

1543
01:29:22,405 --> 01:29:26,136
- Oh, shit. Careful.
- Okay, well...

1544
01:29:27,243 --> 01:29:30,440
So loud. Don't let the parents hear.

1545
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:32,945
You look so pretty.

1546
01:29:36,252 --> 01:29:40,450
- Are you okay?
- I so flirt with you in math.

1547
01:29:40,656 --> 01:29:42,783
Tell me about it. L- Samesies.

1548
01:29:42,992 --> 01:29:48,521
I've wanted to tell you for so long
that you're the best girl.

1549
01:29:48,731 --> 01:29:53,634
I know. I've wanted to get with you,
like, so hard.

1550
01:29:55,238 --> 01:29:57,570
Like so hard.

1551
01:30:03,513 --> 01:30:05,413
You're the best.

1552
01:30:05,615 --> 01:30:09,142
we'll take this sweater off. I think so.

1553
01:30:09,352 --> 01:30:12,583
Just be careful, because it's a
meaningful sweater to me. It's vintage.

1554
01:30:12,789 --> 01:30:13,847
Okay.

1555
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:17,457
- Bought it at that vintage market.
- Just hurry.

1556
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,485
- And this one.
- It's off.

1557
01:30:20,696 --> 01:30:22,789
Hey, wait, careful.

1558
01:30:23,966 --> 01:30:25,490
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my.

1559
01:30:25,701 --> 01:30:26,895
Put that there.

1560
01:30:27,103 --> 01:30:28,798
- Now, looky, looky...
- Okay.

1561
01:30:29,005 --> 01:30:31,565
...what I got for you under here.
- Oh, my gosh.

1562
01:30:31,774 --> 01:30:33,571
You are the prettiest girl...

1563
01:30:33,776 --> 01:30:36,677
...this side of the Mississippi.
- I have a little something...

1564
01:30:36,879 --> 01:30:39,746
...for you under here.

1565
01:30:39,949 --> 01:30:40,973
You look so pretty.

1566
01:30:41,451 --> 01:30:43,749
- Look so pretty.
- Under there.

1567
01:30:43,953 --> 01:30:45,784
Hello.

1568
01:30:47,056 --> 01:30:49,081
For you.

1569
01:30:53,696 --> 01:30:58,133
You're the best. You're so unique.

1570
01:30:58,334 --> 01:30:59,801
Come here.

1571
01:31:00,002 --> 01:31:02,334
Evan, kiss me.

1572
01:31:02,672 --> 01:31:04,469
I like you so much.

1573
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:07,406
Come on, McLovin.

1574
01:31:07,610 --> 01:31:09,441
I've never been
with an older guy before.

1575
01:31:09,645 --> 01:31:12,978
well, it's way better.

1576
01:31:13,182 --> 01:31:15,377
I know, we made some
kick-ass tiramisu earlier.

1577
01:31:15,585 --> 01:31:19,112
It was deli- It looked weird.
But it was delicious.

1578
01:31:23,626 --> 01:31:26,823
what-? what's wrong?

1579
01:31:27,463 --> 01:31:31,058
L- I would prefer
if we would just do that...

1580
01:31:31,267 --> 01:31:34,794
...at some other time.

1581
01:31:35,004 --> 01:31:38,064
No. There is no other time.
School is up.

1582
01:31:38,274 --> 01:31:42,540
- what's wrong with right now?
- well, I mean, you're- You're drunk.

1583
01:31:43,246 --> 01:31:47,148
- You're, like, really, really drunk.
- So? You're drunk. You're drunk, Jules.

1584
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:50,319
Yeah, I'm actually-
I'm not drunk at all.

1585
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:53,080
I don't even drink, so it's...
I mean...

1586
01:31:54,323 --> 01:31:57,383
Jules, you drink. You drink.

1587
01:31:57,593 --> 01:32:00,426
Everybody- You-
You had me get liquor, so you drink.

1588
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:01,654
It's like...

1589
01:32:01,864 --> 01:32:05,197
well, yeah, because
I'm throwing a party, remember?

1590
01:32:05,401 --> 01:32:06,993
Other people drink
and so I just...

1591
01:32:07,203 --> 01:32:08,693
You...?

1592
01:32:10,072 --> 01:32:13,405
You don't wanna, you know?

1593
01:32:15,211 --> 01:32:18,146
Not right now.

1594
01:32:18,347 --> 01:32:21,407
You know, not while you're drunk.

1595
01:32:22,051 --> 01:32:24,042
But, you know, thank you.

1596
01:32:29,392 --> 01:32:33,920
- Evan. Evan, I'm so wet.
- Oh, yeah.

1597
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:37,429
They said that would happen
in health, when I learned about it.

1598
01:32:37,633 --> 01:32:39,430
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1599
01:32:39,635 --> 01:32:42,798
- They taught me about-
- who's down there?

1600
01:32:43,005 --> 01:32:44,233
Yeah, it's your hand.

1601
01:32:49,145 --> 01:32:52,512
- Thank you, that's good.
- You have such a smooth cock.

1602
01:32:52,715 --> 01:32:54,740
Thank you.
You would too if you were a man.

1603
01:32:54,951 --> 01:32:57,442
But you got such a smooth chest.

1604
01:32:57,653 --> 01:33:00,315
I am gonna give you...

1605
01:33:00,523 --> 01:33:04,960
...the best blow-J ever...

1606
01:33:05,161 --> 01:33:07,561
...with my mouth.

1607
01:33:07,763 --> 01:33:09,958
why don't we-?
why don't we just kiss a while?

1608
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:13,761
why don't we keep kissing for a bit,
instead of...?

1609
01:33:15,671 --> 01:33:17,229
How badly do you wanna fuck me?

1610
01:33:17,707 --> 01:33:19,334
Jesus Christ.

1611
01:33:20,142 --> 01:33:21,109
Jesus, fuck.

1612
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:22,572
- Hang on one second.
- what?

1613
01:33:22,778 --> 01:33:24,507
Becca,
I don't think you wanna do this.

1614
01:33:24,714 --> 01:33:28,616
- You're really drunk.
- No, I'm not. I am not drunk.

1615
01:33:28,818 --> 01:33:32,982
- I see that you are. I think you are.
- And I really- I want you inside me.

1616
01:33:33,189 --> 01:33:35,419
I want you to be my first.
I want you inside me.

1617
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:37,820
So just- Just go with it.

1618
01:33:38,027 --> 01:33:39,961
- Let it happen.
- I know, but...

1619
01:33:40,463 --> 01:33:42,454
Becca, this is kind of intense.

1620
01:33:42,665 --> 01:33:46,999
And I just- I'm so drunk.
I can't even, like, process this.

1621
01:33:47,203 --> 01:33:49,535
And you're really pretty.

1622
01:33:49,739 --> 01:33:51,798
And I just think
this isn't how I pictured it.

1623
01:33:52,008 --> 01:33:56,445
I don't understand why you have to be
such a little bitch about it.

1624
01:33:57,647 --> 01:34:00,775
- Did you just call me a bitch?
- Yes, a scared-

1625
01:34:00,983 --> 01:34:03,577
See, I, like,
I think we're not thinking clear-

1626
01:34:03,786 --> 01:34:05,048
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

1627
01:34:05,254 --> 01:34:07,620
- Go get Gaby.
- I'll go get her.

1628
01:34:07,823 --> 01:34:12,556
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Go get Gaby, please.

1629
01:34:26,776 --> 01:34:30,405
- I got a boner.
- Good.

1630
01:34:31,714 --> 01:34:34,308
- Do you have a condom?
- Yes.

1631
01:34:36,252 --> 01:34:38,220
And lube.

1632
01:34:38,421 --> 01:34:39,911
Seth?

1633
01:34:43,893 --> 01:34:46,327
Are-? Are you crying?

1634
01:34:46,729 --> 01:34:49,596
No, I just have something
in both my eyes.

1635
01:34:49,799 --> 01:34:50,959
I don't cry. That's funny.

1636
01:34:51,167 --> 01:34:53,397
You look- You look-
It looks like you're crying.

1637
01:34:53,602 --> 01:34:54,933
So...

1638
01:34:57,173 --> 01:34:59,505
It was my last chance
and I fucked it up and-

1639
01:34:59,709 --> 01:35:01,267
Your last chance to do what?

1640
01:35:01,477 --> 01:35:04,503
To make you
my girlfriend for the summer.

1641
01:35:05,114 --> 01:35:07,947
You're, like, the coolest person
that's ever talked to me.

1642
01:35:08,150 --> 01:35:09,742
I thought we'd both be drunk.

1643
01:35:09,952 --> 01:35:12,682
what does me being drunk
have anything to do with it?

1644
01:35:12,888 --> 01:35:15,186
You'd never get with me
if you were sober.

1645
01:35:15,391 --> 01:35:16,858
Look at you.

1646
01:35:17,927 --> 01:35:22,125
- Look at me.
- Seth, come on, you didn't blow it.

1647
01:35:22,732 --> 01:35:24,324
I think maybe-

1648
01:35:24,967 --> 01:35:26,730
what the fuck?!

1649
01:35:26,936 --> 01:35:28,597
Help me.

1650
01:35:30,806 --> 01:35:31,773
Shirley.

1651
01:35:31,974 --> 01:35:34,033
I'm sorry.

1652
01:35:34,443 --> 01:35:36,934
- Someone forgot to call pest control.
- Yep.

1653
01:35:37,146 --> 01:35:38,977
where you going?
Hey, party's still on.

1654
01:35:39,181 --> 01:35:40,409
- where are you going?
- No.

1655
01:35:40,616 --> 01:35:43,813
If you're back there, get out.
Everyone, come on.

1656
01:35:44,019 --> 01:35:45,782
- we will shoot you.
- Party's over.

1657
01:35:45,988 --> 01:35:47,478
- Evan.
- Get the hell out of here.

1658
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:49,351
Keep your hands up.

1659
01:35:55,131 --> 01:35:57,827
Life's bullshit, Miroki.

1660
01:36:07,209 --> 01:36:09,177
Ev, wake the fuck up, man.

1661
01:36:09,378 --> 01:36:11,676
we gotta go.
Those fucking cops are here, man.

1662
01:36:14,984 --> 01:36:17,282
"Oh, no, it's the cops. "
we have a complaint.

1663
01:36:17,486 --> 01:36:20,011
- Evan, come on.
- Get the hell out of here right now.

1664
01:36:20,222 --> 01:36:21,849
Get out of here.
She's not interested.

1665
01:36:22,057 --> 01:36:24,753
- Drop the crantini and move it, sister.
- See you, sugar tits.

1666
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:25,927
Guys, come on, move.

1667
01:36:26,128 --> 01:36:29,256
Everybody out.
Leave the booze and go.

1668
01:36:30,432 --> 01:36:31,626
what the fuck, man?

1669
01:36:32,434 --> 01:36:33,696
what the fuck, Seth?

1670
01:36:33,903 --> 01:36:36,133
He's my best friend. Oh, shit.

1671
01:36:36,739 --> 01:36:39,139
Oh, shit. Come on.

1672
01:36:39,341 --> 01:36:41,969
I assume you all have guns
and crack.

1673
01:36:44,713 --> 01:36:48,444
Oh, my God, come on. Don't stop.

1674
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:52,385
Okay, everyone...

1675
01:36:52,588 --> 01:36:55,421
...prepare to be fucked
by the long dick of the law.

1676
01:36:55,624 --> 01:36:57,387
Get out.

1677
01:36:59,195 --> 01:37:00,184
Come on, go.

1678
01:37:04,433 --> 01:37:05,991
Fuck off, Seth.

1679
01:37:08,571 --> 01:37:09,765
Get a room.

1680
01:37:09,972 --> 01:37:12,372
I'm gonna save you.
I'm gonna save you, Evan.

1681
01:37:14,009 --> 01:37:15,670
Fuck.

1682
01:37:17,346 --> 01:37:20,543
Fuck. Fuck, man, so heavy.

1683
01:37:35,865 --> 01:37:38,265
It's in. Oh, my God, it's in.

1684
01:37:38,467 --> 01:37:40,833
All right, everybody out.
Come on, let's go.

1685
01:37:41,036 --> 01:37:43,402
McLovin! what the fuck?

1686
01:37:43,606 --> 01:37:45,972
- Officer Slater, is that you?
- You ran away from us.

1687
01:37:46,175 --> 01:37:48,143
why did you run away?
Michaels, get up here.

1688
01:37:48,344 --> 01:37:50,278
- No. I didn't run away.
- what the fuck?

1689
01:37:50,479 --> 01:37:51,468
why would you do that?

1690
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:54,171
- I was disoriented from-
- were you violating that girl?

1691
01:37:54,383 --> 01:37:56,783
You just violated her with your penis?
Michaels, look.

1692
01:37:56,986 --> 01:37:58,351
- McLovin?
- No, no, no.

1693
01:37:58,921 --> 01:38:00,411
No.

1694
01:38:01,056 --> 01:38:02,853
Holy shit.
were you just getting laid?

1695
01:38:03,058 --> 01:38:05,720
No. Yeah, I was, but-

1696
01:38:05,928 --> 01:38:08,192
- Yes, yes, he was.
- It's not what you think, guys.

1697
01:38:08,397 --> 01:38:10,592
- I'm not even-
- Sit the fuck down. Stay down.

1698
01:38:10,799 --> 01:38:12,630
- Calm down.
- I thought we were friends...

1699
01:38:12,835 --> 01:38:14,302
...and then you go running away.

1700
01:38:14,503 --> 01:38:16,130
Contain yourself.

1701
01:38:16,338 --> 01:38:17,828
- we're friends.
- Shut up.

1702
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,304
- Calm down. Calm down, man.
- why? what?

1703
01:38:20,509 --> 01:38:22,101
You just cock-blocked McLovin.
Okay?

1704
01:38:22,311 --> 01:38:23,801
He's our friend. we don't do that.

1705
01:38:24,013 --> 01:38:27,346
we should be guiding his cock,
not blocking it.

1706
01:38:27,549 --> 01:38:31,280
Just relax, okay?
Let's make this right.

1707
01:38:38,961 --> 01:38:41,225
wait, what are you-?
what are you guys doing?

1708
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:44,627
No, please, I can't- I can't go to jail.
Please, I can't go to jail.

1709
01:38:44,833 --> 01:38:48,633
No, look.
we're really sorry, McLovin.

1710
01:38:48,837 --> 01:38:52,170
This has- This has gone on-
This has gone way too far.

1711
01:38:52,374 --> 01:38:55,434
what? what are you talking about?

1712
01:38:55,644 --> 01:38:59,580
we know you're not 25, man.
we're not idiots, McLovin.

1713
01:38:59,782 --> 01:39:02,273
- Yeah.
- Did you know the whole time?

1714
01:39:02,484 --> 01:39:07,649
Look, when we were your age,
we hated cops.

1715
01:39:07,856 --> 01:39:11,019
when we saw you
in the liquor store today, we just...

1716
01:39:11,226 --> 01:39:13,285
I guess we saw a bit of ourselves,
you know...

1717
01:39:13,495 --> 01:39:16,589
...and we just wanted
to show you that...

1718
01:39:16,799 --> 01:39:19,165
...you know, cops can have
a fun time too, you know?

1719
01:39:19,368 --> 01:39:20,960
Yeah.

1720
01:39:21,737 --> 01:39:26,265
You know, in a way,
I think we wanted to show ourselves.

1721
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:30,342
Also, I'm...

1722
01:39:30,546 --> 01:39:33,674
I'm really sorry
that I blocked your cock.

1723
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:37,478
- Apology accepted.
- Seriously, man.

1724
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,078
That feels good.

1725
01:39:40,289 --> 01:39:42,154
- It feels so good.
- I missed you guys.

1726
01:39:42,358 --> 01:39:44,724
I just wish we could
make it up to you somehow, man.

1727
01:39:44,927 --> 01:39:47,555
well, do you think
you can do me a really big favor?

1728
01:39:47,763 --> 01:39:49,822
- what is it? Anything.
- Name it.

1729
01:39:50,032 --> 01:39:53,058
- This kid's fucking crazy.
- Stay back for your own safety.

1730
01:39:53,268 --> 01:39:55,566
Get off me, you fucking cops.
Get your hands off.

1731
01:39:55,771 --> 01:39:58,296
Do you know who I am?
I'm Fogell.

1732
01:39:59,174 --> 01:40:02,575
- The joint can't hold me.
- Holy shit, Fogell's a badass.

1733
01:40:02,778 --> 01:40:05,747
I'm gonna break your glasses,
you fucking cop. You can't hold me.

1734
01:40:05,948 --> 01:40:07,040
Fucking pigs.

1735
01:40:12,021 --> 01:40:13,215
Oh, shit.

1736
01:40:15,824 --> 01:40:17,416
Nice mullet, asshole.

1737
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:19,925
- You crazy.
- This kid's crazy.

1738
01:40:20,129 --> 01:40:23,189
He's nuts.
well, we caught the infamous Fogell.

1739
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:25,026
Get your hands-
wait for me, Nicola.

1740
01:40:25,234 --> 01:40:26,667
wait for me on the outside.

1741
01:40:27,603 --> 01:40:29,730
we were gonna go to Hawaii.

1742
01:40:30,839 --> 01:40:32,534
Man, that's gonna get you
so much ass.

1743
01:40:32,741 --> 01:40:33,708
Seriously?

1744
01:40:33,909 --> 01:40:37,106
- I know what to do about the car.
- Sweet.

1745
01:40:37,713 --> 01:40:41,342
Fucking go. Fucking throw up.

1746
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:46,585
Are you carrying me?

1747
01:40:46,789 --> 01:40:48,916
No, I'm saving you from the cops.

1748
01:40:49,291 --> 01:40:50,280
You saved me?

1749
01:40:52,127 --> 01:40:55,062
well, I don't know what
you're talking about, but thanks.

1750
01:40:55,264 --> 01:40:57,391
Can I- Should I just walk?

1751
01:40:57,599 --> 01:41:01,126
- Should I walk?
- Yeah, sure.

1752
01:41:01,904 --> 01:41:05,897
- Okay.
- where do you wanna go?

1753
01:41:06,742 --> 01:41:09,870
Sleepover at my house?
You wanna come sleep...?

1754
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:14,549
- Okay.
- Okay.

1755
01:41:17,619 --> 01:41:19,314
Does your mom
still have pizza bagels?

1756
01:41:19,521 --> 01:41:21,148
Yeah. Lots.

1757
01:41:21,356 --> 01:41:23,290
Pizza bagels.

1758
01:41:31,533 --> 01:41:34,127
So by signing this,
you are officially saying...

1759
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:36,770
...that as we stopped you
from being mugged...

1760
01:41:36,972 --> 01:41:39,873
...a crackhead stole our cruiser
and did God knows what with it.

1761
01:41:40,075 --> 01:41:42,669
- You cool to sign that?
- Of course. I owe you guys my life.

1762
01:41:42,878 --> 01:41:45,472
we owe you, Mc-
wait, what's your real name again?

1763
01:41:45,681 --> 01:41:46,705
- Fogell.
- Fuck that.

1764
01:41:46,915 --> 01:41:49,475
- we're calling you McLovin.
- McLovin.

1765
01:41:49,685 --> 01:41:52,085
Let's do this dance, boys.

1766
01:42:15,677 --> 01:42:18,339
- Oh, my God.
- what did I tell you guys, right?

1767
01:42:18,547 --> 01:42:19,514
That was crazy.

1768
01:42:25,521 --> 01:42:26,715
All right.

1769
01:42:26,922 --> 01:42:28,856
All right, now, guys, check this out.

1770
01:42:29,057 --> 01:42:32,254
It's probably the greatest move
in doughnut-spinning history.

1771
01:42:32,461 --> 01:42:33,450
You paying attention?

1772
01:42:33,662 --> 01:42:36,927
Behold, the upward-spiraling pigtail.

1773
01:42:37,132 --> 01:42:40,397
- why is it called that?
- I don't know.

1774
01:42:44,573 --> 01:42:46,666
Make the badge proud, Slater.

1775
01:42:48,677 --> 01:42:50,838
He's not usually this drunk
when he does this...

1776
01:42:51,046 --> 01:42:54,174
...but I think
that could make it more cool.

1777
01:42:59,288 --> 01:43:01,017
McLovin!

1778
01:43:11,533 --> 01:43:12,591
Oh, no.

1779
01:43:13,402 --> 01:43:14,733
Fuck.

1780
01:43:21,143 --> 01:43:24,510
- Slater!
- Officer Slater.

1781
01:43:26,315 --> 01:43:29,250
All right. Fucking crazy.

1782
01:43:30,052 --> 01:43:31,019
Let's do this.

1783
01:43:31,887 --> 01:43:36,051
- Hurry, hurry. Let's go. Go, go.
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1784
01:43:36,258 --> 01:43:38,419
- I'm out, I'm out.
- Good, here we go, here we go.

1785
01:43:38,627 --> 01:43:40,720
Yeah? Yeah, okay. Back up.

1786
01:43:40,929 --> 01:43:43,523
Don't blow yourself up, asshole.

1787
01:43:48,704 --> 01:43:52,196
Yes. Oh, my God.

1788
01:43:52,407 --> 01:43:54,807
It worked. It worked.

1789
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:58,946
we won. we won.

1790
01:44:07,556 --> 01:44:09,456
Can we shoot at it?

1791
01:44:10,626 --> 01:44:13,754
I don't know. Can you?

1792
01:44:32,581 --> 01:44:34,276
Break yourself, fool.

1793
01:44:40,656 --> 01:44:42,146
Tight.

1794
01:44:42,357 --> 01:44:44,951
Listen, and then she said
she was gonna give me a blow-J.

1795
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:48,891
- I can't believe she said that to you.
- Man, you have no idea.

1796
01:44:49,097 --> 01:44:51,964
- what was she thinking?
- You don't even know.

1797
01:44:59,775 --> 01:45:03,768
I gotta tell you.
I gotta tell you something, Evan.

1798
01:45:03,979 --> 01:45:05,310
what?

1799
01:45:05,514 --> 01:45:07,379
I was in your room, like,
three weeks ago...

1800
01:45:07,582 --> 01:45:09,812
...while you were taking a shit.

1801
01:45:10,018 --> 01:45:15,012
And I saw your housing, like, forms.

1802
01:45:15,524 --> 01:45:19,722
So I knew you and Fogell
were gonna live together, you know.

1803
01:45:19,928 --> 01:45:22,488
I'm sorry, man, I don't know.

1804
01:45:24,533 --> 01:45:28,629
I should've told you.
I don't know why I didn't.

1805
01:45:28,837 --> 01:45:31,567
Don't- No, don't be sorry.
I should be sorry.

1806
01:45:31,773 --> 01:45:34,503
I was being a dick.
I was being a big dick to you.

1807
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:35,938
No, I-

1808
01:45:36,144 --> 01:45:40,547
Listen, Seth, I want you to know,
I don't wanna live with Fogell.

1809
01:45:40,749 --> 01:45:45,709
I never wanted to live with him.
I just don't- I ha-

1810
01:45:45,921 --> 01:45:48,082
I'm afraid to live with strangers.

1811
01:45:49,958 --> 01:45:51,084
I can't.

1812
01:45:52,194 --> 01:45:54,162
I can't do it.

1813
01:45:55,564 --> 01:45:58,294
I know, I know.

1814
01:45:59,601 --> 01:46:02,468
I can't believe you saved me.

1815
01:46:04,139 --> 01:46:06,266
You saved me.

1816
01:46:06,475 --> 01:46:09,376
I can't believe. I owe you so-

1817
01:46:10,245 --> 01:46:14,375
You carried me. I love you.

1818
01:46:15,016 --> 01:46:16,449
I love you, man.

1819
01:46:19,421 --> 01:46:21,446
I love you.

1820
01:46:22,891 --> 01:46:27,521
I love you. I'm not even
embarrassed to say it. I just-

1821
01:46:27,729 --> 01:46:29,697
I lo- I love you.

1822
01:46:29,898 --> 01:46:31,559
- I'm not embarrassed.
- I love you.

1823
01:46:31,767 --> 01:46:33,234
I love you.

1824
01:46:33,435 --> 01:46:36,199
why don't we say that every day?
why can't we say it more often?

1825
01:46:36,405 --> 01:46:38,635
I just love you. I just wanna
go to the rooftops and scream:

1826
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,137
"I love my best friend, Evan. "

1827
01:46:40,342 --> 01:46:43,971
- we should go up on my roof.
- For sure.

1828
01:46:44,179 --> 01:46:49,981
Like, when you went away for Easter,
on your vacation, I missed you.

1829
01:46:50,185 --> 01:46:53,643
- I missed you too.
- I want the world to know.

1830
01:46:54,089 --> 01:46:58,753
It's- It's the most beautiful thing
in the world.

1831
01:47:02,364 --> 01:47:05,891
Come here. Come here, man.

1832
01:47:16,578 --> 01:47:19,103
- I love you.
- I love you.

1833
01:47:32,127 --> 01:47:34,186
what the fuck?

1834
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:46,564
- what up?
- Morning. Morning.

1835
01:47:47,042 --> 01:47:49,533
I should get moving.
I should get moving.

1836
01:47:49,744 --> 01:47:51,939
I should be getting
a move on, for sure.

1837
01:47:52,147 --> 01:47:55,116
Yeah, you don't-
I mean, you don't have to, you know.

1838
01:47:55,317 --> 01:47:58,377
I don't really have anything
going on.

1839
01:47:58,587 --> 01:48:01,112
You don't have to rush off like that.

1840
01:48:04,626 --> 01:48:06,651
You wanna hang out?

1841
01:48:07,095 --> 01:48:09,529
I was gonna go to the mall.

1842
01:48:09,731 --> 01:48:13,167
I have to get a new comforter.

1843
01:48:13,802 --> 01:48:16,293
For college.
The mall, they would sell that.

1844
01:48:16,505 --> 01:48:18,063
Cool. So...

1845
01:48:19,441 --> 01:48:21,705
...your mom's got huge tits.

1846
01:48:24,346 --> 01:48:25,608
what do you think?

1847
01:48:25,814 --> 01:48:27,179
I don't know, man. Don't ask me.

1848
01:48:27,382 --> 01:48:30,146
Because I don't give a shit
how pants look.

1849
01:48:30,352 --> 01:48:32,718
Yeah, I need someone's opinion.

1850
01:48:32,921 --> 01:48:36,254
Those are too tight.
Those are way too tight.

1851
01:48:36,458 --> 01:48:38,926
- Yeah, but, like-
- way too tight. You need to upgrade.

1852
01:48:39,127 --> 01:48:41,687
There's not enough pants where
there should be. More pants.

1853
01:48:41,897 --> 01:48:44,263
Yeah, but-
I mean, does it look weird?

1854
01:48:44,466 --> 01:48:47,833
Looks like you're standing funny. You
wouldn't stand like that. Like a duck.

1855
01:48:48,036 --> 01:48:49,799
Yeah, but I'm doing like-

1856
01:48:50,005 --> 01:48:53,236
- I'm doing the college poses like-
- I don't know if you are.

1857
01:48:53,441 --> 01:48:55,341
- You might just be doing-
- Hey, prof.

1858
01:48:55,544 --> 01:48:57,603
- Okay.
- That test was...

1859
01:48:58,246 --> 01:49:02,114
Hey, Susan. Are you gonna
party tonight or no?

1860
01:49:02,317 --> 01:49:05,878
Yeah, but that's just- It's like I wish
there were more pants where-

1861
01:49:06,121 --> 01:49:07,349
You know, where there aren't.

1862
01:49:07,589 --> 01:49:09,454
But when I was wearing
your dad's pants...

1863
01:49:09,658 --> 01:49:12,456
...I realized that if I wear pants
that are a little too small...

1864
01:49:12,661 --> 01:49:14,356
...it might encourage me
to lose weight.

1865
01:49:14,563 --> 01:49:16,463
And also,
chicks can kind of see, like...

1866
01:49:16,665 --> 01:49:19,293
...you know, the borders
and outline of my dick a little.

1867
01:49:19,501 --> 01:49:22,470
Yeah, man, they go nuts for that.
The male camel toe.

1868
01:49:22,671 --> 01:49:25,663
Yeah, the camel tail. It's right-

1869
01:49:25,874 --> 01:49:27,535
I know where it is, where it happens.

1870
01:49:27,742 --> 01:49:29,403
Like, right there.

1871
01:49:29,611 --> 01:49:33,172
It's like they're so tight that one ball is,
like, above my dick, even.

1872
01:49:33,381 --> 01:49:35,076
- Yeah, exactly.
- It's like three.

1873
01:49:35,283 --> 01:49:37,877
It's like a three thing.
It's like ball, dick, ball.

1874
01:49:38,086 --> 01:49:39,451
It's like a division sign.

1875
01:49:39,654 --> 01:49:41,451
Like a bunch of people
crammed into a van.

1876
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:46,121
- Making my ass look weird?
- It makes a lot of stuff look weird.

1877
01:49:46,461 --> 01:49:47,894
No, those are way too tight.

1878
01:49:48,730 --> 01:49:51,494
You're right, these look stupid.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1879
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:54,965
I'm really sorry about that.
I can't believe I actually did that.

1880
01:49:55,170 --> 01:49:57,229
I feel bad that I'm making you
buy me a new one.

1881
01:49:57,439 --> 01:49:58,701
It's seems, like, ridiculous.

1882
01:49:58,907 --> 01:50:02,934
- No. I have to, it's puke. It's gross.
- Oh, my God.

1883
01:50:03,144 --> 01:50:05,635
Do alcoholics get hangovers?

1884
01:50:05,847 --> 01:50:08,645
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
It's them.

1885
01:50:09,551 --> 01:50:13,453
- what the fuck do we do, man?
- Don't stop. I don't know.

1886
01:50:15,290 --> 01:50:17,724
- Hey.
- Hey.

1887
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:20,355
How's it going?

1888
01:50:22,097 --> 01:50:24,861
It's so good to-
How are you feeling?

1889
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:28,992
I've felt better. But I'll be fine.
How about you?

1890
01:50:30,105 --> 01:50:34,235
I'm okay, you know, yeah.
Did you have fun last night?

1891
01:50:36,778 --> 01:50:40,305
You know,
I actually don't remember much.

1892
01:50:40,515 --> 01:50:42,039
I don't remember anything.

1893
01:50:42,951 --> 01:50:45,920
- So weird.
- Nothing.

1894
01:50:46,421 --> 01:50:49,015
I didn't puke on you, did I?

1895
01:50:49,491 --> 01:50:51,721
You didn't.
I remember that you- I avoided it.

1896
01:50:51,926 --> 01:50:56,022
It whizzed right by me, and I said,
"Stay away from me," you know.

1897
01:50:56,665 --> 01:51:02,604
I'm really sorry about
everything last night, and I just...

1898
01:51:04,272 --> 01:51:06,706
Thank you for being
such a nice guy about it all.

1899
01:51:07,609 --> 01:51:09,236
That's okay, you know.

1900
01:51:09,444 --> 01:51:12,038
At least you don't have
a black eye from it.

1901
01:51:15,450 --> 01:51:18,578
- That looks terrible.
- Yeah.

1902
01:51:19,487 --> 01:51:23,787
You look great. You don't look terrible.
It's just, like, a bad bruise.

1903
01:51:23,992 --> 01:51:26,722
Everything's great, just from he-
This, just like right there.

1904
01:51:26,928 --> 01:51:28,520
- Your eye.
- Yeah, your eye.

1905
01:51:28,730 --> 01:51:30,357
Everything else is great.

1906
01:51:30,565 --> 01:51:34,558
But seriously,
I acted like a fucking idiot last night.

1907
01:51:37,272 --> 01:51:41,470
You don't deserve that.
So I'm sorry.

1908
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:46,110
On the upside,
I think you look cool with a black eye.

1909
01:51:46,314 --> 01:51:49,681
I'm just gonna throw that out there.
I don't- I don't know.

1910
01:51:49,884 --> 01:51:53,877
well, thank you, smart guy.
Thanks. That's actually why I'm here.

1911
01:51:54,089 --> 01:51:57,388
Because I have to get
a ton of cover-up for the grad photo.

1912
01:51:57,592 --> 01:52:00,026
Oh, man. Fuck.

1913
01:52:00,228 --> 01:52:02,628
And I'm gonna get Jules
a new comforter.

1914
01:52:02,831 --> 01:52:04,765
I have to get a comforter too.
For college.

1915
01:52:04,966 --> 01:52:07,491
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I just figured I would need one.

1916
01:52:07,702 --> 01:52:09,602
So, Seth...

1917
01:52:10,939 --> 01:52:14,898
So do you wanna come
buy me cover-up or something?

1918
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:17,135
I mean, you kind of owe me.

1919
01:52:18,546 --> 01:52:21,913
Yeah, definitely.
I would love to do that.

1920
01:52:22,383 --> 01:52:24,283
I had such bad acne last year...

1921
01:52:24,486 --> 01:52:27,853
...that I pretty much became,
like, an expert on the stuff.

1922
01:52:28,423 --> 01:52:31,017
well, you drove.
Evan drove me here, though, so...

1923
01:52:31,226 --> 01:52:33,251
well, so-
well, I mean, I have my dad's car.

1924
01:52:33,461 --> 01:52:36,294
So I could just give you a lift...

1925
01:52:36,498 --> 01:52:38,523
...and then Evan
could take Becca home.

1926
01:52:38,733 --> 01:52:41,133
If that works.
I don't know if it's in your route.

1927
01:52:41,336 --> 01:52:42,564
It'd be fine with me.

1928
01:52:42,771 --> 01:52:45,535
Fine, yeah.
Maybe we can get some food.

1929
01:52:46,741 --> 01:52:48,003
Yeah, I'd like that.

1930
01:52:50,912 --> 01:52:52,573
So I guess I'll call you, then.

1931
01:52:52,781 --> 01:52:54,772
Yeah, give me a call.
Yeah, you have my number.

1932
01:52:54,983 --> 01:52:58,009
I have your information.
So put her there.

1933
01:52:58,219 --> 01:53:01,188
Perfect. Good. All right, man.

1934
01:53:01,389 --> 01:53:02,788
- Okay.
- Okay, guys.

1935
01:53:02,991 --> 01:53:04,515
- Becca.
- Bye, guys.

1936
01:53:04,726 --> 01:53:06,284
- Bye, have fun.
- See you, Jules.

1937
01:53:06,494 --> 01:53:09,622
Yeah, that's funny. Too funny.

1938
01:53:09,831 --> 01:53:12,322
where do you wanna go to eat?
